NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement_1,NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement,"MODEL INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT Preliminary Notes This agreement can be used for both officers and directors of the corporation.  In some cases, a director will serve as a nominee of one or a group of investors (e.g., an individual venture capitalist serving as a nominee of a venture capital fund).  Because venture capital funds with director nominees may be named as parties or otherwise incur expenses in connection with litigation against their director nominees, some venture capital funds will request that the fund, and not just their director representative, be covered by the indemnification agreement.  To the extent a venture capital fund seeks indemnification for the fund itself, Section 1(d) contains bracketed optional language for the draftsperson to consider.  The working group has not taken a position as to whether investor indemnification is “market.”",General Section,Low
NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement_2,NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement,"Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 145”) is the statutory authority for indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents of the corporation.  Section 145(a) permits (but does not require) indemnification of expenses (including attorneys’ fees) as well as judgments and amounts paid in settlement in third-party actions (i.e., actions not brought by or in the right of the corporation) if the applicable standard is met.  Section 145(b) permits (but does not require) indemnification of expenses (including attorney fees) but not judgments and amounts paid in settlement in derivative actions (i.e., actions brought by or in the right of the corporation) if the applicable standard is met.  Thus, Section 145 draws a basic distinction between third-party and derivative actions.  Section 145(c) requires indemnification of expenses (including attorney fees) if the indemnitee is successful on the merits or otherwise in a proceeding referred to in Section 145(a) or (b).  Section 145(d) sets forth requirements for determining whether indemnification is permitted under Section 145(a) or (b).  Section 145I permits advancement of expenses before final disposition of a proceeding subject to certain conditions.  Section 145(f) provides that the statutory rights and procedures regarding indemnification are not exclusive, thus permitting indemnification under bylaws, agreements and other circumstances beyond the limits specified in Section 145.  Section 145(g) allows a corporation to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O insurance”).  Sections 145(h) through (k) address various other aspects of indemnification, including provisions relating to survivorship of the obligations of the indemnifying corporation, survivorship of rights to indemnification upon ceasing to be a director, officer, employee or agent and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery over indemnification proceedings.",Rights & Obligations,Low
NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement_3,NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement,"Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law is the other relevant statutory authority relating to the protection of directors from monetary liability.  Section 102(b)(7) allows inclusion of a provision in the certificate of incorporation that eliminates or limits (i.e., caps) the personal liability of directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty.  The statute, however, prohibits limitations on director liability (i) for breach of a director’s duty of loyalty, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (iii) for willful or negligent conduct in paying dividends or repurchasing stock out of other than lawfully available funds, or (iv) for any transaction from which a director derives an improper personal benefit.  In essence, Section 102(b)(7) allows a corporation to protect its directors from monetary liability for duty of care violations.  As noted above, Section 145(f) provides that statutory indemnification rights are not exclusive of indemnification rights that may be provided by a bylaw provision, agreement or otherwise.  As discussed below, although Section 145(f) could be read broadly to allow a corporation to grant by contract indemnification rights beyond those permitted by Section 145, cases and commentators suggest that contractual indemnification rights may be held unenforceable if they violate other statutes (including Section 145), court decisions or public policy.  As a result, the enforceability of contracts that purport to grant indemnification rights beyond those permitted by Section 145 is at best unclear.  (For further discussion, see comment under Section 2 below.) An indemnification agreement may serve several purposes.  First, and most importantly, it may provide more secure protection than a provision in a certificate of incorporation or bylaw because it cannot be amended without the approval of the indemnitee.  Second, it can be used to make mandatory indemnification that is permissive under Section 145, to specify various procedures and presumptions that make indemnification more favorable to the indemnitee than is provided by Section 145 and to perhaps provide for indemnification rights that go beyond those that are expressly provided by Section 145.  While such provisions could also be included in the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, an agreement permits different rights to be granted to specific directors, officers, employees and agents, rather than in a one size fits all approach. Some companies choose to provide mandatory indemnification for directors (i.e., the Company is required to indemnify a director if the applicable conditions are met) and discretionary indemnification for officers (i.e., indemnification is at the discretion of the Company even if the applicable conditions are met).  With respect to indemnification of directors, as discussed in the comment under Section 6(b), there may be no disinterested directors to consider approval of discretionary indemnification for directors.  Accordingly, absent mandatory indemnification a board decision to indemnify itself may not be subject to the court deference under the business judgment rule.  With respect to indemnification of officers, there may be situations (e.g., termination of employment, sexual harassment) where mandatory indemnification of officers would expose the Company to the possibility of funding the defense of litigation either brought by the Company or in which the Company wants to distance itself from the activities of the officer in question.  Care should be taken to anticipate such situations. Also note that if the Company decides to indemnify directors but not officers, the indemnification agreement should make it clear that an employee director is indemnified only in his or her capacity as a director.",Rights & Obligations,Low
NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement_4,NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement,"Section 145(g) specifically authorizes a corporation to obtain D&O insurance for directors and officers for liability asserted against them in such capacity or arising out of such status whether or not the corporation has the power to indemnify such persons against such liability under Section 145.   D&O insurance coverage is important for several reasons.  First, even though indemnification may be permitted under Section 145, the corporation may be unwilling or unable to indemnify the individual.  The former situation may arise after a change in corporate control where the corporation is unwilling to indemnify the individual.  This may be the case, for example, if the director is the subject of litigation resulting from efforts to prevent the change in control.  Alternatively, a corporation may be unable to provide indemnification because it is insolvent.  Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, for example, indemnification claims by directors or officers would generally be treated as unsecured claims payable only to the extent that other unsecured claims are payable as part of an approved plan of reorganization. Second, D&O insurance may insure against liabilities where indemnification is not allowed under Section 145.  This occurs most frequently in the context of derivative actions and securities law actions.  In particular, Section 145(g) permits a corporation to obtain insurance for (i) judgments or amounts paid in settlement in derivative actions, and (ii) for expenses incurred when a director has been adjudged liable in some respects, even though indemnification under such circumstances would not be allowed under Section 145(b).  In addition, a D&O insurance policy may insure against liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), even though the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has taken the position that indemnification for liabilities under Section 11 of the 1933 Act are against public policy and courts have held that indemnification for violations of the 1933 and the 1934 Act are contrary to the public policy in certain circumstances.  (See comment under Section 1(a) of the Agreement.)  As a result, D&O insurance may be particularly important for publicly held companies where there is greater risk of liability for derivative actions and securities law claims.   However, D&O insurance policies generally contain a number of qualifications and limitations that narrow the scope of coverage.  In particular, D&O insurance coverage is limited by applicable insurance law as well as public policy considerations.  In addition, D&O insurance policies generally exclude certain conduct from coverage, including short-swing profit liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act, unauthorized remuneration, personal profit to which the insured individual is not legally entitled, claims arising out of contests for corporate control and claims brought by corporations against their own directors and officers.  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of [___________], 20[__] between [corporation], a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and [name] (“Indemnitee”). WITNESSETH THAT: WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve corporations as [directors] [officers] or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation; WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities.  Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among United States-based corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions.  At the same time, directors, officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business enterprise itself.  [The [Bylaws] [and] [Certificate of Incorporation] of the Company require indemnification of the officers and directors of the Company.]  Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”).  The [Bylaws] [and] [Certificate of Incorporation] and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the Board, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification; WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons; WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company’s stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future; WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified;  WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the [Bylaws] [and] [Certificate of Incorporation] of the Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder; and WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the Company’s [Bylaws] [and] [Certificate of Incorporation] and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and may not be willing to serve as an officer or director without adequate protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity.  Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he or she be so indemnified; and WHEREAS, Indemnitee has certain rights to indemnification and/or insurance provided by [name of fund/sponsor] which Indemnitee and [name of fund/sponsor] intend to be secondary to the primary obligation of the Company to indemnify Indemnitee as provided herein, with the Company’s acknowledgement and agreement to the foregoing being a material condition to Indemnitee’s willingness to serve on the Board. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Indemnitee’s agreement to serve as an [officer] [director] from and after the date hereof, the parties hereto agree as follows: Indemnity of Indemnitee.  The Company hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time.  In furtherance of the foregoing indemnification, and without limiting the generality thereof: [Comment:  Sections 1 and 2 of the agreement contain the basic indemnification obligations of the agreement.  Section 1 provides for indemnification that essentially tracks Section 145, while Section 2 provides for broader indemnification (e.g., by providing for indemnification of judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement of derivative actions).  The overlap in coverage of the two (2) sections is intentional.  Indemnification under Section 1 is designed to be available even if a Delaware court does not allow indemnification under Section 2 in a particular instance.",Rights & Obligations,High
NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement_5,NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement,"Section 1 essentially requires indemnification to the fullest extent permitted or required under Section 145.  Thus, Section 1 makes mandatory indemnification that is permissive under Sections 145(a) and (b).  Note that Section 1 does not make mandatory a determination under Section 145(d) that the applicable standard of conduct has been satisfied.  Therefore, even though mandatory, indemnification under Sections 1(a) and (b) is subject to a determination under Section 145(d) and Section 6(b) that the applicable standard has been satisfied.] Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company.  Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this Section 1(a) if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status (as hereinafter defined), the Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding (as hereinafter defined) other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company.  Pursuant to this Section 1(a), Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses (as hereinafter defined), judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful. [Comment:  Section 145(a) permits indemnification of officers, directors, employees or agents for attorneys’ fees and other expenses as well as for judgments or amounts paid in settlement in civil cases.  As noted above, Section 145(a) applies only to third-party actions and not to derivative actions.  The person seeking indemnification must have acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of, or not opposed to the best interests of, the corporation in connection with the claim made against such person.  In criminal cases, the indemnitee may be indemnified for fines and costs provided that, in addition to the foregoing standard of conduct, the indemnitee must not have had reasonable cause to believe that indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful.  Section 1(a) of the Agreement essentially tracks Section 145(a), except that it makes indemnification mandatory rather than permissive.   The distinction between third-party and derivative actions is critical to understanding the statutory framework.  A derivative action is an action brought by the corporation or by a stockholder on behalf of the corporation to redress a wrong done by someone to the corporation.  Therefore, the derivative action must be based upon an alleged injury to the corporation which caused harm to the corporation itself, and to the stockholder only derivatively through their ownership of stock in the corporation.  In some cases, there can be uncertainty as to whether a particular action constitutes a derivative action (i.e., to address a breach of a duty to the corporation) or a third-party action (i.e., a direct harm to the third party plaintiff). Proceedings that allege breach of fiduciary duties of officers and directors to the corporation often are derivative actions, and actions against officers and directors for violations of federal securities laws (e.g., actions alleging a violation of Section 11 of the 1933 Act in connection with a public offering of securities or Rule 10b-5 in connection with an offer or sale of securities) would normally be third-party actions.  Therefore, absent public policy concerns, an action against a director or officer alleging federal securities law liability would fall within the relatively favorable third-party indemnification provisions of Section 145(a).  As noted above, Section 145(a) permits indemnity even if the director or officer loses the case, so long as the indemnitee meets the applicable standard following a determination pursuant to Section 145(d). The SEC has taken the position, however, that even if a director or officer meets the relevant standard of conduct for indemnification under corporate law, corporate indemnification for liabilities arising under the 1933 Act is against public policy.  In addition, courts have held that indemnification for violations of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act is contrary to public policy, at least for violations based upon culpable behavior greater than ordinary negligence. These public policy limitations may apply to a variety of sources of liability under the 1933 Act and 1934 Act, including (i) Section 12 of the 1933 Act for offers and sales of securities, (ii) Rule 10b-5 of the 1934 Act for violation of antifraud provisions, (iii) Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act for short–swing trading profits, (iv) Section 15 of the 1933 Act and Section 20 of the 1934 Act for liability of control persons and Section 18 of the 1934 Act for misleading statements.  Thus, even though otherwise permissible under Section 145(a), indemnification may be contrary to the public policy underlying the federal securities laws and therefore unenforceable.  These potential limitations on indemnity underscore the importance of having separate D&O Insurance coverage.]   Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company.  Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this Section 1(b) if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, the Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company.  Pursuant to this Section 1(b), Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee, or on the Indemnitee’s behalf, in connection with such Proceeding if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; provided, however, if applicable law so provides, no indemnification against such Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall determine that such indemnification may be made. [Comment:  Section 145(b) permits indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents for attorneys’ fees and other expenses in derivative actions but not for judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement of such actions.  However, in a proceeding where the individual is adjudged to be liable to the corporation, Section 145(b) does not permit indemnification even for expenses unless and to the extent that an appropriate court determines that, in view of all the circumstances, the individual is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses.  Thus, indemnification for derivative actions is significantly more limited than for third-party actions.  The rationale for this distinction is that any liability in a derivative action is to make the corporation (on whose behalf the action was brought) whole for harm it suffered, and the corporation would not receive any benefit by indemnifying an individual against such liability.  In effect, the corporation would be returning funds to the person liable to pay them.  As with Section 1(a), Section 1(b) essentially tracks Section 145(b), except that it makes indemnification mandatory rather than permissible. Note that by eliminating or limiting a director’s exposure to financial liability for breaches of certain classes of fiduciary duties, Section 102(b)(7) may reduce exposure for claims that would otherwise result in derivative actions and thereby overcome some of the limitations on indemnification in Section 145(b).] Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a party to (or participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, he or she shall be indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time, against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection therewith.  If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one (1) or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter.  For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter. [Comment:  Section 145(c) requires the corporation to indemnify a director or officer for attorney fees and other expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a proceeding referred to in Sections 145(a) or (b) to the extent that the indemnitee is “successful on the merits or otherwise.”  In other words, an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for reasonable expenses to the extent successful on the merits, even if the indemnitee is successful for “technical” reasons and without the need for a determination as to whether the director or officer met the applicable standard of conduct.  Section 1(c) essentially tracks Section 145(c).  Prior to the 2020 amendments to the DGCL, Section 145(c) did not define the “officers” to whom mandatory indemnification under Section 145(c) must be provided.  Pursuant to the 2020 amendments to the DGCL, for indemnification with respect to any act or omission occurring after December 31, 2020, references to an “officer” for purposes of Section 145(c), shall mean only a person who at the time of such act or omission is deemed to have consented to service by the delivery of process to the registered agent of the corporation pursuant to Section 3114(b) of title 10 of the Delaware Code.  Thus, by reference to Section 3114(b), the “officers” entitled to mandatory indemnification under Section 145(c) are (i) the president, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief legal officer, controller, treasurer or chief accounting officer, (ii) any individual identified in public filings as one of the most highly compensated officers of the corporation or (iii) any individual who, by written agreement with the corporation, has consented to be identified as an officer for purposes of Section 3114(b).  The 2020 amendments also added a new subsection (Section 145(c)(2)), which allows for the extension of mandatory indemnification of expenses under Section 145(c) to persons other than Section 3114(b) officers.  As a result, new subsection 145(c)(2) permits a corporation to provide mandatory indemnification under Section 145(c) to officers who are not Section 3114(b) officers.  With respect to acts or omissions occurring before December 31, 2020, officers who are not Section 3114(b) officers should remain entitled to the statutory protection under Section 145(c).] Indemnification of Appointing Stockholder.  If (i) Indemnitee is or was affiliated with one (1) or more venture capital funds that has invested in the Company (an “Appointing Stockholder”), and (ii) the Appointing Stockholder is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding, and (iii) the Appointing Stockholder’s involvement in the Proceeding (A) arises primarily out of, or relates to, any action taken by the Company that was approved by the Company’s Board, and (B) arises out of facts or circumstances that are the same or substantially similar to the facts and circumstances that form the basis of claims that have been, could have been or could be brought against the Indemnitee in a Proceeding, regardless of whether the legal basis of the claims against the Indemnitee and the Appointing Stockholder are the same or similar, then the Appointing Stockholder shall be entitled to all rights and remedies, including with respect to indemnification and advancement, provided to the Indemnitee under this Agreement as if the Appointing Stockholder were the Indemnitee. The rights provided to the Appointing Stockholder under this Section 1(d) shall be suspended during any period during which the Appointing Stockholder does not have a representative on the Company’s Board[, and terminate on the closing of an initial public offering of the Company’s Common Stock; provided, however, that in the event of any such suspension or termination, the Appointing Stockholder’s rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses will not be suspended or terminated with respect to any Proceeding based in whole or in part on facts and circumstances occurring at any time prior to such suspension or termination regardless of whether the Proceeding arises before or after such suspension or termination.] The Company and Indemnitee intend and agree that the Appointing Stockholder is an express third party beneficiary of the terms of this Section 1(d). [Comment: As noted in the introduction, Section 1(d) contains optional language extending the indemnification and advancement rights provided to a venture fund’s designee on the board of directors to the venture capital fund appointing the director.]  Partial Indemnification.  If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Expenses, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. Additional Indemnity.  In addition to, and without regard to any limitations on, the indemnification provided for in Section 1 of this Agreement, the Company shall and hereby does indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee against all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, he or she is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding (including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company), including, without limitation, all liability arising out of the negligence or active or passive wrongdoing of Indemnitee.  The only limitation that shall exist upon the Company’s obligations pursuant to this Agreement shall be that the Company shall not be obligated to make any payment to Indemnitee that is finally determined (under the procedures, and subject to the presumptions, set forth in Sections 6 and 7 hereof) to be unlawful. [Comment:  Section 2 provides for additional indemnification beyond the scope of indemnification provided by Section 1.  For example, Section 2 provides for mandatory indemnification of judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement of derivative actions.  The only limitation is that no indemnification is required to the extent that it is finally determined to be unlawful in accordance with procedures and presumptions set forth in the agreement.   The scope of additional protection provided by Section 2 is unclear.  As noted above, although Section 145(f) expressly permits contractual indemnification rights beyond the statutory rights provided for in Section 145, the enforceability of such contractual rights may be limited by statute, court decision and public policy. Contractual indemnification rights beyond Section 145 can be classified into different categories that may be helpful in assessing their enforceability.  Some contractual rights make indemnification which is permissive under Section 145 mandatory (e.g., a provision requiring indemnification relating to third-party actions to the extent permitted under Section 145(a)).  Other contractual rights attempt to clarify or supplement statutory rights without significantly altering those rights (e.g., a procedural requirement that a corporation advance expenses within a certain period of time following a proper undertaking from the indemnitee or defining “independent legal counsel” for purposes of making a determination under Section 145(d)).  Still other contractual rights specify policies, procedures and presumptions that have the purpose or effect of enhancing indemnification rights beyond the provisions of Section 145 (e.g., a presumption that an individual has met the applicable standard of care or a provision that a determination that the applicable standard of care is deemed to be met if no such determination is made within a specified period).  Finally, some contractual indemnification rights appear to be inconsistent with the limits on indemnification specified in Section 145 (e.g., a provision indemnifying for judgments in derivative actions even if the indemnitee has engaged in intentionally culpable behavior). One commentator has noted:  “There is no case which spells out the precise perimeters of the extent to which an indemnification agreement . . . may go in providing indemnification rights . . . under Section 145(f) . . .  Although there is no case law on point, it is probable that a Delaware court would not allow indemnification under a . . . contract when the proposed indemnification is prohibited by law or public policy. . . . Nevertheless, Section 145(f) does provide support for wide-ranging agreements which broaden or enlarge upon indemnification rights granted in the various other subsections of Section 145, although provisions in such a[n] . . . agreement which are contrary to limitations or prohibitions set forth in other subsections may be held unenforceable if they violate other statutes, court decisions or public policies. . . . For example, because of the limitations of Section 145(b), a corporation may not be able to indemnify under the authority of Section 145(f) for judgments or amounts paid in settlements in derivative suits. . . . On the other hand, Section 145(f) may authorize the adoption of various procedures and presumptions to make the process of indemnification more favorable to the indemnitee without violating that statute.”  See Balotti and Finkelstein, Delaware Law of Corporation and Business Organizations, § 4.12[E] at 4-97 to 4-98. Sometimes a contract providing for indemnification beyond Section 145 will itself contain limitations on the scope of additional indemnification.  These limitations might include prohibitions on indemnification for (i) violations of insider trading laws such as Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act, (ii) conduct that is determined to be knowingly fraudulent or deliberately dishonest or to constitute willful misconduct, (iii) actions brought by the corporation, (iv) actions brought by the indemnitee without board approval, and (v) actions relating to proxy contests in opposition to the board.  See Section 9 below.] Contribution. [Comment:  The provisions regarding contribution are primarily intended to provide an alternative means of protecting individuals from liability for some types of federal securities law violations where indemnification is unenforceable for public policy reasons.  For example, Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act explicitly recognizes contribution in cases where one (1) or more persons are or may be subject to the same liability under Section 11, even though the SEC takes the position that indemnification for Section 11 violations is contrary to public policy.]   Whether or not the indemnification provided in Sections 1 and 2 hereof is available, in respect of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), the Company shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount of any judgment or settlement of such action, suit or proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such payment and the Company hereby waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have against Indemnitee.  The Company shall not enter into any settlement of any action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding) unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all claims asserted against Indemnitee. [Comment:  Section 3(a), in effect, provides that where the corporation and the individual are jointly liable (or if joined, would be), the corporation shall contribute 100% of the liability, and the individual would not be required to contribute anything.  Section 3(a) also prohibits the corporation from entering into any settlement that does not completely release the individual.] Without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the Company set forth in the preceding subparagraph, if, for any reason, Indemnitee shall elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any judgment or settlement in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), the Company shall contribute to the amount of Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred and paid or payable by Indemnitee in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, from the transaction or events from which such action, suit or proceeding arose; provided, however, that the proportion determined on the basis of relative benefit may, to the extent necessary to conform to law, be further adjusted by reference to the relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company other than Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, in connection with the transaction or events that resulted in such expenses, judgments, fines or settlement amounts, as well as any other equitable considerations which applicable law may require to be considered.  The relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the degree to which their actions were motivated by intent to gain personal profit or advantage, the degree to which their liability is primary or secondary and the degree to which their conduct is active or passive. [Comment:  Section 3(b) provides an alternative method of allocating the amount contributed by the corporation and the individual in the event that the method of allocation in Section 3(a) (i.e., 100% payment by the corporation) is not enforceable.  In particular, Section 3(b) provides for allocation based on the relative benefits received from the transaction giving rise to liability, and if required to conform to law, the relative fault of the parties.] The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless from any claims of contribution which may be brought by officers, directors, or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee. [Comment:  Section 3(c) attempts to indemnify the indemnitee against contribution sought from other third parties.] To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s). [Comment:  Section 3(d) provides for contribution by the Company even if the Company is not held jointly liable based on the relative benefit to the Company of the conduct of the indemnitee giving rise to the loss or expenses incurred by the indemnitee and/or the relative fault of the Company and the indemnitee in connection with the matter in question.] Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a witness, or is made (or asked) to respond to discovery requests, in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, he or she shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection therewith. [Comment:  Section 4 indemnifies individuals for costs and expenses in serving as a witness in any proceeding relating to such person’s service to the corporation.] Advancement of Expenses.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding by reason of Indemnitee’s Corporate Status within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding.  Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.  Any advances and undertakings to repay pursuant to this Section 5 shall be unsecured and interest free.  This Section 5 shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 9. [Comment:  As noted above, Section 145(e) provides for the advancement of attorney’s fees and other expenses to officers and directors in connection with any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative proceeding.  Section 145(e) conditions any advance upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such individual is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation.",Rights & Obligations,High
NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement_6,NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement,"Section 5 is modeled after Section 145(e), except that it makes the corporation’s duty to advance expenses mandatory rather than permissive.  Section 5 also supplements Section 145(e) in various respects.  Section 5 requires payment within thirty (30) days after receipt of a request for advancement (provided the request includes a statement of the expenses and an undertaking to repay any advance expenses if it is determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification against such expenses).  Section 5 also provides that the Company is not required to advance expenses to the Indemnitee for claims for which indemnification is not permitted pursuant to this Agreement. As an alternative to requiring a separate undertaking from Indemnitee, the Agreement could provide that the execution and delivery of the Agreement itself constitutes the required undertaking by including the following language:  “The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery to the Company of this Agreement, which shall constitute an undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the amounts advanced (without interest) by the Company pursuant to this Section 5, if and only to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.  No other form of undertaking shall be required other than the execution of this Agreement.”] Procedures and Presumptions for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification.  It is the intent of this Agreement to secure for Indemnitee rights of indemnity that are as favorable as may be permitted under the DGCL and public policy of the State of Delaware.  Accordingly, the parties agree that the following procedures and presumptions shall apply in the event of any question as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement: [Comment:  Section 6 specifies policies and procedures to be applied in determining whether an individual is entitled to indemnification under the Agreement.  As with other provisions of the agreement, these policies and procedures are not specifically authorized by Section 145.  As a result, the rights and procedures specified in Section 6 may be unenforceable.  See the comment under Section 2 of the Agreement above.  Note, however, that unlike indemnification agreements customarily entered into in financings (e.g., between the issuer and underwriters in an underwritten public offering), this Agreement (and most indemnification agreements) do not delineate defense procedures.] To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.  The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure of Indemnitee to provide such a request to the Company, or to provide such a request in a timely fashion, shall not relieve the Company of any liability that it may have to Indemnitee unless, and to the extent that, such failure actually and materially prejudices the interests of the Company.  The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own Expense. Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of Section 6(a) hereof, a determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case by one of the following four methods, which shall be at the election of the Board: (i) by a majority vote of the disinterested directors, even though less than a quorum, (ii) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by a majority vote of the disinterested directors, even though less than a quorum, (iii) if there are no disinterested directors or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee, or (iv) if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company.  For purposes hereof, disinterested directors are those members of the Board who are not parties to the action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by Indemnitee. [Comment:  As noted above, Section 145(e) provides that indemnification under Sections 145(a) and (b) must be authorized on a case-by-case basis (unless ordered by a court) in accordance with a statutorily mandated decision making process.  The determination that must be made in each case is whether indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth Section 145(a) or (b).  Such determination may be made (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to the proceeding, (ii) by a committee of such directors, (iii) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders. There are a number of practical problems in making a determination pursuant to Section 145(d).  First, many actions that give rise to indemnification claims will be brought against all directors and therefore preclude a determination by majority vote of disinterested directors.  One solution might be to appoint additional disinterested directors to make a determination, although this course of action may present its own difficulties.  Second, many corporations and directors will be reluctant to use the alternative of seeking stockholder approval, particularly for publicly held corporations where the approval process would be difficult and widely publicized.  Third, the term “independent legal counsel” is not defined in Section 145 or applicable case law, and even if a well-established definition existed, a number of issues would arise in rendering a required opinion should experienced counsel agree to consider doing so.",Rights & Obligations,Low
NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement_7,NVCA-2020-Indemnification-Agreement,"Section 6(b) allows the board to select the method of determination.  Some agreements for public companies provide that independent counsel make the determination following a change in control (presumably on the theory that directors and stockholders after a change in control may be less inclined to act impartially) and allow the Company to select the method of determination otherwise.  Other agreements purport to vest this authority in the Indemnitee, but such a provision could be challenged as an unlawful delegation of the board’s responsibility to manage the business and affairs of the corporation under Section 141(a) of the DGCL.   For a public company where it is desired to provide that following a change of control the indemnification determination would be made by independent counsel, an example of a typical “change of control” definition follows: __.__.A “Change in Control” shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest to occur after the date of this Agreement of any of the following events: 	(i)  Acquisition of Stock by Third Party.  Any Person (as defined below) is or becomes the Beneficial Owner (as defined below), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing [fifteen percent (15%)] or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities [unless the change in relative Beneficial Ownership of the Company’s securities by any Person results solely from a reduction in the aggregate number of outstanding shares of securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors]; 	(ii)  Change in Board.  During any period of two (2) consecutive years (not including any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board, and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Sections __(a)(i), __(a)(iii) or __(a)(iv)) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company’s stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a least a majority of the members of the Board; 	(iii)  Corporate Transactions.  The effective date of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty-one percent (51%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation and with the power to elect at least a majority of the Board or other governing body of such surviving entity; 	(iv)  Liquidation.  The approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; and 	(v)  Other Events.  There occurs any other event of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A (or a response to any similar item on any similar schedule or form) promulgated under the Exchange Act (as defined below), whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement. For purposes of this Section __(a), the following terms shall have the following meanings: 	(A)	“Exchange Act” shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 	(B)	“Person” shall have the meaning stated in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act; provided, however, that Person shall exclude (i) the Company, (ii) any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company and (iii) any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company.   	(C)	“Beneficial Owner” shall have the meaning given to such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that Beneficial Owner shall exclude any Person otherwise becoming a Beneficial Owner by reason of the stockholders of the Company approving a merger of the Company with another entity.] If the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 6(c).  The Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board.  Indemnitee may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of “Independent Counsel” as defined in Section 13 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion.  Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel.  If a written objection is made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit.  If, within twenty (20) days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 6(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Indemnitee to the Company’s selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 6(b) hereof.  The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof, and the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Company and the Indemnitee incident to the procedures of this Section 6(c), regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed. [Comment:  Sections 6(c) through (g) specify procedures and presumptions that apply in making a determination of entitlement to indemnification.  Section 6(c) gives the Board the right to select independent legal counsel, subject to an objection procedure.  Some public company agreements vest the ability to select the Independent Counsel in the Indemnitee after a change of control; but such a provision could be challenged as an unlawful delegation of the board’s responsibility to manage the business and affairs of the corporation under Section 141(a) of the DGCL.  Section 6(d) below creates a presumption that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, allocates the burden of proof to the party seeking to overcome the presumption and specifies an applicable standard of proof.  Section 6(e), among other things, creates a presumption that the indemnitee acted in accordance with the standard of conduct required for indemnification, allocates the burden of proof to the party seeking to overcome the presumption, specifies the applicable standard of proof and specifies circumstances under which the indemnitee is deemed to have acted in good faith.  Section 6(f) below provides for a determination of entitlement if no determination is made by the decision-maker within sixty (60) days after a request for determination (plus a thirty (30) day extension right) subject to certain conditions.  Section 6(g) below requires the indemnitee to cooperate with the person or persons making the determination, requires such person or persons to act reasonably and in good faith and requires the corporation to pay certain costs associated with making the determination. In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement.  Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.  Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. [Comment:  Indemnification agreements may be subject to review by state securities law administrators if the corporation’s securities are registered or qualified in their state.  For example, the California Department of Corporations has objected to shifting the burden of proof as provided in this Section 6(d).  In one instance, a corporation was required to renegotiate indemnification agreements with its directors to eliminate a similar provision before qualifying an issuance of securities in California.] Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee’s action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise (as hereinafter defined), including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Enterprise.  The provisions of this Section 6(e) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.  In addition, the knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.  Whether or not the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(e) are satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that Indemnitee has at all times acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company.  Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence. If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section 6 to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such sixty (60) day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time to obtain or evaluate documentation and/or information relating thereto; and provided further, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(f) shall not apply if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the stockholders pursuant to Section 6(b) of this Agreement and if (A) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination, the Board or the Disinterested Directors, if appropriate, resolve to submit such determination to the stockholders for their consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within seventy five (75) days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of stockholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within sixty (60) days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat. Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.  Any Independent Counsel, member of the Board or stockholder of the Company shall act reasonably and in good faith in making a determination regarding the Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement.  Any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom. In the event that any action, suit or proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without limitation, settlement of such action, suit or proceeding with or without payment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such action, suit or proceeding.  Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence. [Comment:  Section 6(h) creates a presumption that any resolution of a claim other than by adverse judgment against the Indemnitee (including a settlement, regardless of whether money is paid) constitutes being “successful on the merits or otherwise” for purposes of Section 145(c).  Section 6(h) also allocates the burden of proof to the party seeking to overcome the presumption and specifies the standard of proof in overcoming the presumption.  If enforceable, this provision is particularly helpful because it would allow for mandatory indemnification pursuant to Section 145(c).] The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Remedies of Indemnitee. In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification is made pursuant to Section 6(b) of this Agreement within ninety (90) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Sections 1(c), 1(e), 4 or the last sentence of Section 6(g) of this Agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Sections 1(a), 1(b) and 2 of this Agreement within ten (10) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or such determination is deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, of Indemnitee’s entitlement to such indemnification.  Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication within one hundred eighty (180) days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 7(a).  The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee’s right to seek any such adjudication. [Comment:  Section 7(a) provides for a right of adjudication before a Delaware court in the event of certain adverse results under the Agreement.  Some indemnification agreements also provide that Indemnitee, at his or her option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.] In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 6(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 7 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial on the merits, and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of the adverse determination under Section 6(b). [Comment:  Sections 7(b) through 7(e) seek to extend statutory indemnification rights pursuant to Section 145(f).] If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 6(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 7, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee’s misstatement not materially misleading in connection with the application for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law. In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 7, seeks a judicial adjudication of his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, or to recover under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, the Company shall pay on his or her behalf, in advance, any and all expenses (of the types described in the definition of Expenses in Section 13 of this Agreement) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in such judicial adjudication, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance recovery. The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this Section 7 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.  It is the intent of the Company that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees or other Expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Indemnitee hereunder.  The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefore) advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, if, in the case of indemnification, Indemnitee is wholly successful on the underlying claims; if Indemnitee is not wholly successful on the underlying claims, then such indemnification shall be only to the extent Indemnitee is successful on such underlying claims or otherwise as permitted by law, whichever is greater. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding. Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Primacy of Indemnification; Subrogation. The rights of indemnification as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders, a resolution of directors of the Company, or otherwise.  No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his or her Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.  To the extent that a change in the DGCL, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification than would be afforded currently under the Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.  No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy. To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees, or agents or fiduciaries of the Company or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that such person serves at the request of the Company, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary under such policy or policies.  If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies.  The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. [Comment:  Some indemnification agreements require the corporation to obtain (or use commercially reasonable or best efforts to obtain) D&O insurance with specified policy limits or other terms.  Instead, this agreement requires the corporation to furnish the Indemnitee with the maximum level of D&O insurance coverage provided to other like parties.] [The Company hereby acknowledges that Indemnitee has certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by [Name of Fund/Sponsor] and certain of [its][their] affiliates (collectively, the “Fund Indemnitors”).  The Company hereby agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to Indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Fund Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by Indemnitee are secondary), (ii) that it shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement and the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company (or any other agreement between the Company and Indemnitee), without regard to any rights Indemnitee may have against the Fund Indemnitors, and (iii)  that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Fund Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Fund Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof.  The Company further agrees that no advancement or payment by the Fund Indemnitors on behalf of Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Company shall affect the foregoing and the Fund Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee against the Company.  The Company and Indemnitee agree that the Fund Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section 8(c).] [Comment: This provision is intended to be used for directors appointed by investment funds to address the ruling in Levy et al. v. HLI Operating Company, Inc., 2007 WL 1500032 (Del. Ch. May 16, 2007), which held that investment funds providing indemnification to their partners who serve on boards of fund portfolio companies are co-indemnitors with the portfolio company and, therefore, are not entitled to recover from the portfolio company the full amount of any payments advanced on behalf of the partner-director.  Rather, the fund only has a claim for contribution to the extent it advanced more than its fair share.  In the absence of a provision such as the above, it is possible the Levy case will be broadly construed to obligate a fund providing such indemnification to contribute its share of any payments made by any other party providing like indemnification to its director designees.] Except as provided in paragraph (c) above, in the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee (other than against the Fund Indemnitors), who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights. Except as provided in paragraph (c) above, the Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise. [Comment:  This provision integrates indemnification under the agreement with indemnification from other sources by providing that payments under the agreement shall be offset by payments from other sources, other than from the Fund Indemnitors as provided in paragraph (c).] Except as provided in paragraph (c) above, the Company’s obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. Exception to Right of Indemnification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnity in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee: for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, provided, that the foregoing shall not affect the rights of Indemnitee or the Fund Indemnitors set forth in Section 8(c) above; or for (i) an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or similar provisions of state statutory law or common law, (ii) any reimbursement of the Company by the Indemnitee of any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by the Indemnitee from the sale of securities of the Company, as required in each case under the Exchange Act (including any such reimbursements that arise from an accounting restatement of the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), or the payment to the Company of profits arising from the purchase and sale by Indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) or (iii) any reimbursement of the Company by Indemnitee of any compensation pursuant to any compensation recoupment or clawback policy adopted by the Board or the compensation committee of the Board, including but not limited to any such policy adopted to comply with stock exchange listing requirements implementing Section 10D of the Exchange Act; or except as provided in Section 7(e) of this Agreement, in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors, officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation, (ii) such payment arises in connection with any mandatory counterclaim or cross claim brought or raised by Indemnitee in any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) or (iii) the Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law.[Comment:  This provision is designed to prevent the indemnitee from being indemnified for actions brought by the indemnitee except as otherwise provided. as well as for liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act, for certain reimbursements of the Company by Indemnitee and where payment has already been made under an insurance policy.] The following additional exception can be added to address concerns that the Company will be required to provide indemnification for conduct that violates the Company’s code of conduct/business practices: “(d) for Expenses determined by the Company to have arisen out of Indemnitee’s breach or violation of his or her obligations under (i) any employment agreement between the Indemnitee and the Company or (ii) the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (as amended from time to time).”]   Duration of Agreement.  All agreements and obligations of the Company contained herein shall continue during the period Indemnitee is an officer or director of the Company (or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) [consider extending for several years after term of service, even if claim has not yet been paid] and shall continue thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any Proceeding (or any proceeding commenced under Section 7 hereof) by reason of his or her Corporate Status, whether or not he or she is acting or serving in any such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification can be provided under this Agreement.  [This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), assigns, spouses, heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives.] Security.  To the extent requested by Indemnitee and approved by the Board, the Company may at any time and from time to time provide security to Indemnitee for the Company’s obligations hereunder through an irrevocable bank line of credit, funded trust or other collateral.  Any such security, once provided to Indemnitee, may not be revoked or released without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee. Enforcement. The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered into this Agreement and assumes the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to serve as an officer or director of the Company, and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in serving as an officer or director of the Company. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Company shall not seek from a court, or agree to, a “bar order” which would have the effect of prohibiting or limiting the Indemnitee’s rights to receive advancement of expenses under this Agreement. [Comment:  See In re HealthSouth Corp. Securities Litigation, 572 F.3d 854 (11th Cir. 2009).] Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement: “Corporate Status” describes the status of a person who is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that such person is or was serving at the request of the Company. “Disinterested Director” means a director of the Company who is not and was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by Indemnitee. “Enterprise” shall mean the Company and any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary. “Expenses” shall include all reasonable attorneys’ fees, retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees, travel expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees, [and any federal, state, local or foreign taxes imposed on the Indemnitee as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Agreement], ERISA excise taxes and penalties, and all other disbursements or expenses of the types customarily incurred in connection with prosecuting, defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating, participating, or being or preparing to be a witness in a Proceeding, or responding to, or objecting to, a request to provide discovery in any Proceeding.  Expenses also shall include (i) Expenses incurred in connection with any appeal resulting from any Proceeding, including, without limitation, the premium, security for, and other costs relating to any cost bond, supersedeas bond, or other appeal bond or its equivalent (ii) Expenses incurred in connection with recovery under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee is ultimately determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement or Expenses or insurance recovery, as the case may be, and (iii) for purposes of Section 7(e) only, Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, by litigation or otherwise.  Expenses, however, shall not include amounts paid in settlement by Indemnitee or the amount of judgments or fines against Indemnitee. “Independent Counsel” means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither at present is, nor in the past five (5) years has been, retained to represent (i) the Company or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party (other than with respect to matters concerning Indemnitee under this Agreement, or of other indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements), or (ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Independent Counsel” shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement.  The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel against any and all Expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto. “Proceeding” includes any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, claim, counterclaim, cross claim, arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding, whether brought by or in the right of the Company or otherwise and whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including any appeal therefrom, in which Indemnitee was, is or will be involved as a party or otherwise, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, by reason of any action taken by him or her, or of any inaction on his or her part, while acting in his or her Corporate Status; in each case whether or not he or she is acting or serving in any such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification, reimbursement or advancement of expenses can be provided under this Agreement; including one pending on or before the date of this Agreement, but excluding one initiated by an Indemnitee pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement to enforce his or her rights under this Agreement. Severability.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.  [Further, the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof as to either Indemnitee or Appointing Stockholder shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any provision hereof as to the other.]  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement is intended to confer upon Indemnitee [and Appointing Stockholder] indemnification rights to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws.  In the event any provision hereof conflicts with any applicable law, such provision shall be deemed modified, consistent with the aforementioned intent, to the extent necessary to resolve such conflict. [Comment: Use the bracketed language in Section 14 if a version of the indemnification of Appointing Stockholder language is used in Section 1(d)] Modification and Waiver.  No supplement, modification, termination or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Notice By Indemnitee.  Indemnitee agrees promptly to notify the Company in writing upon being served with or otherwise receiving any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding or matter which may be subject to indemnification covered hereunder.  The failure to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of any obligation which it may have to Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise unless and only to the extent that such failure or delay materially prejudices the Company. Notices.  All notices and other communications given or made pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given (a) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified, (b) when sent by confirmed electronic mail if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and if not so confirmed, then on the next business day, (c) five (5) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (d) one (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with written verification of receipt.  All communications shall be sent:   To Indemnitee at the address set forth below Indemnitee signature hereto. To the Company at: ______________________________ ______________________________ ______________________________ Attention:______________________ or to such other address as may have been furnished to Indemnitee by the Company or to the Company by Indemnitee, as the case may be. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same the same instrument.  Counterparts may be delivered via electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, e.g., www.docusign.com) or other transmission method and any counterpart so delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.   Headings.  The headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof.

NVCA-2020-Management-Rights-Letter-1_1,NVCA-2020-Management-Rights-Letter-1,"MANAGEMENT RIGHTS LETTER Preliminary Notes The assets of a pension plan subject to the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) must be held in trust.  Moreover, the persons responsible for managing those assets have significant fiduciary duties under ERISA and cannot engage in certain transactions prohibited by ERISA.  If a pension plan covered by ERISA (an “ERISA Plan”) invests in a venture fund, then all of the fund’s assets - such as its investments in portfolio companies - are treated as assets of the ERISA Plan, absent an exemption.  As a result, the trust requirement applies, the managing partner of the fund is treated as an ERISA fiduciary, and the fund must comply with the rules regarding prohibited transactions. The U.S. Department of Labor, which is charged with administering ERISA, has issued regulations that contain certain exemptions from the plan assets rules.  Under one (1) exemption, a venture fund is not deemed to hold ERISA plan assets if it qualifies as a venture capital operating company (a “VCOC”).  To qualify as a VCOC, the fund must have at least fifty percent (50%) of its assets invested in venture capital investments.  An investment in a portfolio company qualifies as a “venture capital investment” if the fund obtains certain management rights with respect to the portfolio company.  “Management rights,” in turn, are defined as contractual rights running directly from the portfolio company to the fund that give the fund the right to participate substantially in, or substantially influence the conduct of, the management of the portfolio company.  In addition to obtaining management rights, the fund is also required to actually exercise its management rights with respect to one (1) or more of its portfolio companies every year. In order to build a case for an exemption from the ERISA Plan asset rules, a venture fund will generally ask each of its portfolio companies to sign a management rights letter in connection with the fund’s initial investment.  An example of such a letter follows.

NVCA-Model-COI-10-1-2025_1,NVCA-Model-COI-10-1-2025,"AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION  Preliminary Notes General.  The Certificate of Incorporation is a key document produced in connection with a venture capital portfolio investment. Among other things, the Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation establishes the powers, preferences and special rights of each class and series of the Corporation’s stock. No Impairment Clause.  A “no impairment” clause is a broad and general provision that prohibits the Corporation from acting (or failing to act) in a way that would circumvent the express and specific provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. Although Delaware courts narrowly construe “no impairment” clauses, such provisions can be dangerous, both to the Corporation and to the controlling investors, because they can give rise to claims of violation by disgruntled minority investors looking for some grounds on which to base a claim, in the absence of any specific protective provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation. In addition, in a transaction in which the terms of the outstanding Preferred Stock are to be amended, specifically the anti-dilution and conversion rights, certain law firms have taken the position that the existence of a “no impairment” clause in the Certificate of Incorporation requires their firm to express no opinion with regard to the stockholder action taken in connection with the subject transaction, and instead assume for purposes of their opinion that the Corporation has complied with the provisions of the “no impairment” clause. If appropriate attention is paid to the specific, substantive provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, there is no need for a vague catchall, which may give rise to the problems described above. Accordingly, the drafters intentionally did not include a “no impairment” clause in this model charter. Pay-to-Play Provision.  This model charter includes a sample “pay-to-play” provision, pursuant to which Preferred Stock investors are penalized if they fail to invest to a specified extent in certain future rounds of financing. The provision included provides for conversion into Common Stock of some or all of the Preferred Stock held by non-participating investors. Blank Check Preferred.  Blank check preferred is the term used when the Certificate of Incorporation authorizes shares of undesignated Preferred Stock and grants the Board of Directors the authority to create a new series of Preferred Stock and establish the powers, preferences, and special rights of such series. Without this express grant of authority to the Board of Directors, the Corporation would need to obtain stockholder approval to amend the Certificate of Incorporation to create a new series of Preferred Stock. The drafters view the inclusion of blank check preferred in a Certificate of Incorporation for a venture backed company as unusual. Accordingly, this model charter assumes that blank check preferred will not be used and the drafters intentionally did not include a provision authorizing blank check preferred. Choice of Jurisdiction.  This form is set up for a portfolio company incorporated in Delaware. Delaware is generally the preferred jurisdiction for incorporation of venture-backed companies for many reasons, including: The Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) is a modern, current, and internationally recognized and copied corporation statute which is updated annually to take into account new business and court developments; Delaware offers a well-developed body of case law interpreting the DGCL, which facilitates certainty in business planning; The Delaware Court of Chancery is considered by many to be the nation’s leading business court, where judges expert in business law matters deal with business issues in an impartial setting; and Delaware offers an efficient and user-friendly Secretary of State’s office permitting, among other things, prompt certification of filings of corporate documents. Please note the following special considerations if the Corporation is located in California, even though incorporated in Delaware: Considerations for Corporation with California Shareholders and Operations.",Investment Terms,High
NVCA-Model-COI-10-1-2025_2,NVCA-Model-COI-10-1-2025,"Section 2115 of the California Corporations Code provides that certain provisions of California corporate law are applicable to foreign corporations (e.g., one incorporated in Delaware), to the exclusion of the law of the state of incorporation, if more than half of the Corporation’s shareholders and more than half its “business” (a defined formula based on property, payroll and sales) are located in California. As a result, some companies based in California may be subject to certain provisions of the California corporate law despite being incorporated in another state, such as Delaware (although, as noted below, it is not clear that courts will apply Section 2115 if the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation is inconsistent with the provisions of Section 2115). Section 2115 does not apply to public companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE MKT, the NASDAQ Global Market or the NASDAQ Capital Market. One provision of the California Corporations Code that applies to such “quasi-California” corporations is Section 708, which requires that shareholders be permitted to cumulate votes in the election of directors. However, Section 2115 does not require corporations to set forth this right in their articles or bylaws, and most Silicon Valley companies that are subject to Section 2115 do not do so. Under Delaware law, a corporation must include a provision in its Certificate of Incorporation in order to allow cumulative voting (see Section 214 of the DGCL). Therefore, should a stockholder choose to exercise its right to cumulate votes under Sections 2115 and 708 of the California Corporations Code, the corporation may find itself forced to choose between violating those provisions if it denies cumulative voting, or violating Section 214 of the DGCL if it allows it. Current California case law enforces a shareholder’s rights to cumulate votes in this situation, relying on the language of Section 2115 stating that the cited provisions of the California Code apply “to the exclusion of the law of the jurisdiction in which [the corporation] is incorporated.” See Wilson v. Louisiana-Pac. Res., Inc., 187 Cal. Rptr. 852 (Ct. App. 1982). However, a Delaware case, VantagePoint Venture Partners 1996 v. Examen, Inc., 871 A.2d 1108 (Del. 2005), held that the provisions of Section 2115 of the California Corporation Code, insofar as they purport to regulate what stockholder vote is required to approve a corporate action, are inapplicable to a Delaware corporation, regardless of the Corporation’s California contacts. In late May 2012, a California Court of Appeals case, Lidow v. Superior Ct., 141 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (Ct. App. 2012), for the first time signaled acceptance of the analysis in VantagePoint by a California court; however, this decision did not explicitly speak to Section 2115 and practitioners remain advised that it may be prudent for “quasi-California” corporations to comply with Section 2115 whenever possible.  Another provision applicable to such “quasi-California” corporations is the restriction on distributions to shareholders under Section 500 of the California Corporations Code. California Corporations Code Section 166 defines “distributions to shareholders” to include all transfers of cash or property to shareholders without consideration, including dividends paid to shareholders (except stock dividends), and the redemptions or repurchases of stock by a corporation or its subsidiary (subject to certain exclusions, such as the repurchase of stock held by employees). The consequence of this broad definition is that dividends, stock repurchases, and stock redemptions are all subject to the same tests and restrictions. Unlike Delaware law, which generally permits companies to pay dividends or make redemptions as long as the Corporation is solvent following the transaction, California law prohibits such payments unless the Corporation meets certain mechanical tests (in particular, that either retained earnings equal or exceed the size of the proposed distribution or that assets equal or exceed current liabilities). Additionally, California requires quasi-California companies to take “preferential dividends” and “preferential rights” into account when making distributions. However, California does allow such companies to waive these preferred stock considerations. As a result of the restrictions in Section 500, quasi-California companies may be precluded by California law from making a required dividend or redemption payment, even though such a payment would be permissible under Delaware law. Under California Corporations Code Section 316(a)(1), also applicable to “quasi-California” corporations, directors are liable to the corporation for illegal distributions if they acted willfully or negligently with respect to such a distribution.  The limitations on director and officer indemnification under Section 317 of the California Corporations Code also purport to be applicable to a “quasi-California” corporation. As a result, counsel may want to tailor indemnification provisions for a “quasi-California” corporation to reflect California law so that all parties have consistent expectations with regard to indemnification of officers and directors. Finally, Section 1001 and 1101, and Chapter 12 and 13 of the California Corporations Code also purport to apply to “quasi-California” corporations. These provisions deal with mergers, reorganizations, and asset sales, including voting rights and the application of California dissenters’ rights. California may require class votes on sale transactions, so parties should consider whether additional voting agreements are appropriate to secure a possible Common Stock class vote in such a transaction. Additionally, in contrast to Delaware law, California law will grant dissenters’ rights in connection with the sale of assets in exchange for stock of an acquiring corporation. Furthermore, California law will require a fairness opinion in connection with certain interested party transactions, so the parties should take particular care if a merger, reorganization or asset sale involves a potentially interested party.

The “Original Issue Price” shall mean, with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, $[insert initial Series A purchase price] per share, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the applicable Preferred Stock.

The right to receive dividends on shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 1 shall not be cumulative, and no right to dividends shall accrue to holders of Preferred Stock by reason of the fact that dividends on such shares are not declared or paid. Payment of any dividends to the holders of Preferred Stock shall be on a pro rata, pari passu basis in proportion to the applicable Dividend Amount for each series of Preferred Stock. Subject to the preferential rights described above, the Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation (other than dividends on shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock) in any calendar year unless (in addition to the obtaining of any consents required elsewhere in this Certificate of Incorporation) the holders of the Preferred Stock then outstanding shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, in addition to the dividends payable pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 1, a dividend on each outstanding share of Preferred Stock in an amount at least equal to (i) in the case of a dividend on Common Stock, the product of (A) the dividend declared, paid or set aside on such Common Stock and (B) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of such Preferred Stock; (ii) in the case of a dividend on a class or series of capital stock that is convertible into Common Stock, the product of (A) the dividend declared, paid or set aside per share of such class or series of capital stock and (B) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of such Preferred Stock, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of such class or series of capital stock; or (iii) in the case of a dividend on any class or series that is not convertible into Common Stock, the product of (A) the amount of the dividend payable on each share of such class or series of capital stock divided by the original issuance price of such class or series of capital stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to such class or series) and (B) the applicable Original Issue Price (as defined below); provided that, if the Corporation declares, pays or sets aside, on the same date, a dividend on shares of more than one class or series of capital stock of the Corporation, the dividend payable to the holders of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this sentence of Section 1 shall be calculated based upon the dividend on the class or series of capital stock that would result in the highest dividend for such series of Preferred Stock.

If upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or Deemed Liquidation Event, the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Preferred Stock the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this Section 2.1, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after the payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders or, in the case of a Deemed Liquidation Event, the consideration not payable to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.1 or the remaining Available Proceeds, as the case may be, shall be distributed among the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares held by each such holder, treating for this purpose all such securities as if they had been converted to Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. The aggregate amount which a holder of a share of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 is hereinafter referred to as the “Liquidation Amount.” Deemed Liquidation Events. Definition. Each of the following events shall be considered a “Deemed Liquidation Event” unless the holders of at least [specify percentage], of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis (the “Requisite Holders”), elect otherwise by written notice sent to the Corporation at least 10 days prior to the effective date of any such event: a merger, consolidation, statutory conversion, transfer of the Corporation, domestication, or continuance in which  the Corporation is a constituent party or  a subsidiary of the Corporation is a constituent party and the Corporation issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger, consolidation, statutory conversion, transfer of the Corporation, domestication, or continuance,  except any such merger, consolidation, statutory conversion, transfer of the Corporation, domestication, or continuance involving the Corporation or a subsidiary in which the shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such merger, consolidation, statutory conversion, transfer of the Corporation, domestication, or continuance continue to represent, or are converted into or exchanged for shares of capital stock or other equity interests that represent, immediately following such merger, consolidation, statutory conversion, transfer of the Corporation, domestication, or continuance, [a majority[, by voting power,]] of the capital stock or other equity interests of (1) the surviving or resulting corporation or entity; or (2) if the surviving or resulting corporation or entity is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation or entity immediately following such merger, consolidation, statutory conversion, transfer of the Corporation, domestication, or continuance, the parent corporation or entity of such surviving or resulting corporation or entity; or  (i) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition (whether by merger, consolidation, statutory conversion, transfer of the Corporation, domestication, continuance or otherwise, and whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of one or more subsidiaries of the Corporation if substantially all of the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by such subsidiary or subsidiaries, except where such sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation.  [Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.3.1 to the contrary, in no event shall the sale and issuance by the Corporation of Preferred Stock in a bona fide equity financing of the Corporation, in and of itself, be a Deemed Liquidation Event.]  Effecting a Deemed Liquidation Event.  The Corporation shall not have the power to effect a Deemed Liquidation Event referred to in Section 2.3.1(a)(i) unless the agreement or plan with respect to such transaction, or terms of such transaction (any such agreement, plan or terms, the “Transaction Document”), provide that the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation in such Deemed Liquidation Event shall be allocated to the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.2. [In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event referred to in Section 2.3.1(a)(ii) or 2.3.1(b), if the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the Corporation under the General Corporation Law within 90 days after such Deemed Liquidation Event, then (i) the Corporation shall send a written notice to each holder of Preferred Stock no later than the 90th day after the Deemed Liquidation Event advising such holders of their right (and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the terms of the following clause (ii) to require the redemption of such shares of Preferred Stock, and (ii) if the Requisite Holders so request in a written instrument delivered to the Corporation not later than 120 days after such Deemed Liquidation Event, the Corporation shall use the consideration received by the Corporation for such Deemed Liquidation Event (net of any retained liabilities associated with the assets sold or technology licensed, any other expenses reasonably related to such Deemed Liquidation Event or any other expenses incident to the dissolution of the Corporation as provided herein, in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), together with any other assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, all to the extent permitted by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders (the “Available Proceeds”) on the 150th day after such Deemed Liquidation Event (the “DLE Redemption Date”), to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the applicable Liquidation Amount; provided, that if the definitive agreements governing such Deemed Liquidation Event contain contingent indemnification obligations on the part of the Corporation and prohibit the Corporation from distributing all or a portion of the Available Proceeds while such indemnification obligations remain outstanding, then the DLE Redemption Date shall automatically be extended to the date that is ten business days following the date on which such prohibition expires. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Available Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each holder’s shares of Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of such Available Proceeds, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the Available Proceeds were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders. Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this Section 2.3.2(b), the Corporation shall not expend or dissipate the Available Proceeds for any purpose, except to discharge expenses incurred in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event. In connection with a distribution or redemption provided for in Section 2.3.2, the Corporation shall send written notice of the redemption (the “Redemption Notice”) to each holder of record of Preferred Stock. Each Redemption Notice shall state: the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by the holder that the Corporation shall redeem on the date specified in the Redemption Notice; the redemption date and the price per share at which the shares of Preferred Stock are being redeemed; for holders of shares in certificated form, that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed. If the Redemption Notice shall have been duly given, and if payment is tendered or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor in a timely manner, then notwithstanding that any certificates evidencing any of the shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the payment without interest upon surrender of any such certificate or certificates therefor.] Amount Deemed Paid or Distributed. The amount deemed paid or distributed to the holders of capital stock of the Corporation upon any such merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, exclusive license, other disposition or redemption shall be the cash or the value of the property, rights or securities to be paid or distributed to such holders pursuant to such Deemed Liquidation Event. The value of such property, rights or securities shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors[, including the approval of [at least one] Preferred Director (as defined herein)].  Allocation of Escrow and Contingent Consideration. In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to Section 2.3.1(a)(i), if any portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies (the “Additional Consideration”), the Transaction Document shall provide that (a) the portion of such consideration that is not Additional Consideration (such portion, the “Initial Consideration”) shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.2 as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event; and (b) any Additional Consideration which becomes payable to the stockholders of the Corporation upon satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.2 after taking into account the previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction. For the purposes of this Section 2.3.4, consideration placed into escrow or retained as a holdback to be available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar obligations in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event shall be deemed to be [Initial Consideration] [Additional Consideration]. Voting. General. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible (as provided in Section 4 below) as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as provided by law or by the other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class and on an as-converted to Common Stock basis. Election of Directors.  (i) At all times when at least [__] shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Preferred Stock), (x) the holders of record of the shares of Preferred Stock, exclusively and voting together as a separate class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, shall be entitled to elect [__] director[s] of the Corporation (the “Preferred Director[s]”); and (y) the holders of record of the shares of Common Stock, exclusively and voting together as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect [__] directors of the Corporation; and (ii) the holders of record of the shares of Common Stock and of any other class or series of voting stock (including the Preferred Stock), exclusively and voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Common Stock basis, shall be entitled to elect the balance of the total number of directors of the Corporation (the “At-Large Directors”). [Notwithstanding the foregoing, for administrative convenience, the initial Preferred Director[s] may also be appointed by the Board of Directors in connection with the approval of the initial issuance of Preferred Stock without a separate action by the holders of Preferred Stock].,   Any director elected as provided in Section 3.2(a)(i) or Section 3.2(a)(ii) [or appointed by the last sentence of Section 3.2(a)] may be removed without cause by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the class or series of capital stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders.   If the holders of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors pursuant to Section 3.2(a) [(and to the extent any of such directorships is not otherwise filled by a director appointed in accordance with the last sentence of Section 3.2(a))], then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant until such time as the holders of the Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, fill such directorship in accordance with Section 3.2(a). A vacancy in any At-Large Director seat can be filled by either (A) the vote or written consent in lieu of a meeting of the stockholders entitled to elect the At-Large Directors, or (B) the vote or written consent in lieu of a meeting of [all/a majority of the] remaining director(s) [elected by the stockholders entitled to elect the At-Large Directors].   At any meeting held for the purpose of electing a director, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the class or series of capital stock entitled to elect such director shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing such director. For purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation, “Requisite Directors” means the Board of Directors [including [a majority of] the Preferred Directors then seated].  Preferred Stock Protective Provisions. At any time when at least [____] shares of Preferred Stock [(subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Preferred Stock)] are outstanding, the Corporation shall not, either directly or indirectly by amendment, merger, consolidation, domestication, transfer of the Corporation, continuance, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, waiver, statutory conversion, or otherwise, effect any of the following acts or transactions without (in addition to any other vote required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation) the written consent or affirmative vote of the Requisite Holders[, and any such act or transaction that has not been approved by such consent or vote prior to such act or transaction being effected shall be null and void ab initio, and of no force or effect]. liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the business and affairs of the Corporation or effect any Deemed Liquidation Event; amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation [in a manner that adversely affects the special rights, powers and preferences of the Preferred Stock (or any series thereof)]; [effect any merger, consolidation, reorganization, statutory conversion, transfer of the Corporation, domestication, or continuance (other than a Deemed Liquidation Event) pursuant to which the holders of the Corporation’s Preferred Stock immediately prior to such transaction are issued securities in such transaction in lieu of such shares of Preferred Stock that have special rights, powers and preferences that are materially less favorable than the special rights, powers and preferences of such Preferred Stock immediately prior to such transaction]; create any capital stock unless the same ranks junior to [or pari passu with] the Preferred Stock with respect to its special rights, powers and preferences; increase [or decrease] the authorized number of shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, or any series thereof;  purchase or redeem (or permit any subsidiary to purchase or redeem) or pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution on, any shares of capital stock of the Corporation other than (i) redemptions of or dividends or distributions on the Preferred Stock as expressly authorized herein, (ii) dividends or other distributions payable on the Common Stock solely in the form of additional shares of Common Stock, (iii) repurchases of stock from former employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons who performed services for the Corporation or any subsidiary in connection with the cessation of such employment or service at no greater than the original purchase price thereof and (iv) redemptions, dividends or repurchases approved by the Requisite Directors; create, or hold capital stock in, any subsidiary that is not wholly owned (either directly or through one or more other subsidiaries) by the Corporation (or substantially wholly owned other than de minimis holdings of a second holder as may be required by non-U.S. law), or permit any subsidiary to create,  or issue or obligate itself to issue, any shares of any class or series of capital stock, or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any capital stock of any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, or permit any direct or indirect subsidiary to sell, lease, transfer, exclusively license or otherwise dispose (in a single transaction or series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary; [or] [increase or decrease the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors, or change the number of votes entitled to be cast by any director or directors on any matter[; or][.] [unless otherwise approved by the Requisite Directors: [unless the aggregate indebtedness of the Corporation and its subsidiaries for borrowed money following such action would not exceed $[_______]/the amount already included in the annual budget approved in accordance with Section 3.3.9(f) and] other than equipment leases, bank lines of credit or trade payables incurred in the ordinary course of business, create,  or issue, any debt security, create any lien or security interest (except for purchase money liens or statutory liens of landlords, mechanics, materialmen, workmen, warehousemen and other similar persons arising or incurred in the ordinary course of business), or incur other indebtedness for borrowed money, including but not limited to obligations and contingent obligations under guarantees, or permit any subsidiary to take any such action with respect to any debt security lien, security interest or other indebtedness for borrowed money;] [(i) create or adopt any equity (or equity-linked) compensation plan;

(ii) provides for acceleration of vesting; or (iii) is not subject to a right of first refusal in favor of the Corporation;] [create or modify the composition or members of any committee of the Board of Directors in such a manner as does not include each Preferred Director, other than a Preferred Director excluded from such committee formed for the purpose of avoiding conflicts of interest in which such Preferred Director’s inclusion would create such conflict of interest;] [sell, issue, sponsor, create or distribute, or cause or permit any of its subsidiaries to sell, issue, sponsor, create or distribute, any digital tokens, cryptocurrency or other blockchain-based assets (collectively, “Tokens”), including through a pre-sale, initial coin offering, token distribution event or crowdfunding, or through the issuance of any instrument convertible into or exchangeable for Tokens;] [enter into any commercial contract outside the ordinary course of business involving the payment, contribution, or assignment by the Corporation of money or assets having a value (as determined by the Board of Directors in a manner consistent with the agreements governing such relationship) greater than $[_______]];  [any license or transfer of the Corporation’s (or its subsidiaries’) intellectual property or assets to a third party in a material transaction or series of related transactions that, viewed in the aggregate, would be material and in connection with which such third party or its affiliates contemporaneously directly engages the services of any of the Corporation’s senior executives in their individual capacities (including transactions commonly referred to as acquihires)]; [or] [enter into a real estate lease having a term longer than, or extend a real estate lease to result in a term longer than, three years, unless [either (i)] the aggregate annual cost to the Corporation is less than $[_______][or (ii) it is included in an annual budget or any amendment thereto approved in accordance with Section 3.3.9(f)].] Optional Conversion. The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows (the “Conversion Rights”): Right to Convert.  Conversion Ratio. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such whole number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (calculated as provided in Section 4.2 below), as is determined by dividing the applicable Original Issue Price by the applicable Conversion Price (as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The “Conversion Price” applicable to the Preferred Stock as of the Original Issue Date shall be equal to $_______ [insert original purchase price of Series A Preferred Stock] per share of Series A Preferred Stock. Such initial Conversion Price for a series of Preferred Stock, and the rate at which shares of Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 4. [Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding Section 4.3.1, the optional right to convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 4.1.1 shall be suspended, and no optional conversion may be effective, from and after the date the Corporation delivers (pursuant to Section 5A.1 below) notice of a Qualified Financing (as defined below) until immediately after the earlier of (x) consummation of the Qualified Financing and the associated Special Mandatory Conversion or (y) termination of the Qualified Financing; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation on the right to optionally convert shares into Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4.1.1 shall not affect the calculation of the number of shares deemed issuable upon conversion of such shares for purposes of (A) voting rights under this Certificate of Incorporation, or (B) determining amounts payable in respect of shares of Preferred Stock in connection with a dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Corporation or pursuant to a Deemed Liquidation Event.] Termination of Conversion Rights. In the event of a notice of redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.3.2(b) [or Section 6.1], the Conversion Rights of the shares designated for redemption shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. [Eastern/Pacific] time (the “close of business” for purposes hereof) on the last full day preceding the date fixed for redemption, unless the redemption price is not fully paid on such redemption date, in which case the Conversion Rights for such shares shall continue until such price is paid in full. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred Stock; provided that the foregoing termination of Conversion Rights shall not affect the amount(s) otherwise paid or payable in accordance with Section 2.1 to the holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event. Number of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable to a holder of Preferred Stock upon conversion of such Preferred Stock shall be the nearest whole share, after aggregating all fractional interests in shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of all shares of that same series of Preferred Stock being converted by such holder (with any fractional interests after such aggregation representing 0.5 or greater of a whole share being entitled to a whole share). For the avoidance of doubt, no fractional interests in shares of Common Stock shall be created or issuable as a result of the conversion of the Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4.1.1. Mechanics of Conversion. Notice of Conversion. In order for a holder of Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall (a) provide written notice to the Corporation at the principal office of the Corporation that such holder elects to convert all or any number of such holder’s shares of Preferred Stock and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent and (b) if such holder’s shares are certificated, tender to the Corporation at its principal office (1) the certificate or certificates for such shares of Preferred Stock or (2) a stock assignment separate from certificate if such certificate or certificates are electronic (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate). If required by the Corporation, any certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. [Unless a later time and date is otherwise specified by the holder,] the close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such notice and, if applicable, certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) shall be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the specified shares shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time (i) issue and deliver to such holder of Preferred Stock, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates (whether electronic or physical) for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common Stock, and (ii) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted. Reservation of Shares. The Corporation shall at all times when the Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation. Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price. Effect of Conversion. All shares of Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. No Further Adjustment. Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion. Taxes. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid. Adjustments to Preferred Stock Conversion Price for Diluting Issues. Special Definitions. For purposes of this Article Fourth, the following definitions shall apply: “Additional Shares of Common Stock” means all shares of Common Stock issued (or, pursuant to Section 4.4.3 below, deemed to be issued) by the Corporation after the Original Issue Date (as defined below), other than (1) the following shares of Common Stock and (2) shares of Common Stock deemed issued pursuant to the following Options and Convertible Securities (clauses (1) and (2), collectively, “Exempted Securities”): as to any series of Preferred Stock, shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities issued as a dividend or distribution on such series of Preferred Stock (including dividends payable in connection with dividends on other classes or series of stock); shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities issued by reason of a dividend, stock split, split-up or other distribution on shares of Common Stock that is covered by Section 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 or 4.8;  [shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities issued to banks, equipment lessors or other financial institutions, or to real property lessors, pursuant to a debt financing, equipment leasing or real property leasing transaction [approved by the Requisite Directors] [that do not exceed an aggregate of [______] shares of Common Stock (including shares underlying (directly or indirectly) any such Options or Convertible Securities)];] shares of Common Stock or Options issued to employees or directors of, or consultants or advisors to, the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to a plan, agreement or arrangement [approved (i) prior to the Original Issue Date or (ii) by the Requisite Directors];  shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities actually issued upon the exercise of Options or shares of Common Stock actually issued upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities, in each case provided such issuance is pursuant to the terms of such Option or Convertible Security; [shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities issued to suppliers or third party service providers in connection with the provision of goods or services pursuant to transactions [approved by the Requisite Directors] [that do not exceed an aggregate of [______] shares of Common Stock (including shares underlying (directly or indirectly) any such Options or Convertible Securities)];] [shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities issued as acquisition consideration pursuant to the acquisition of another corporation by the Corporation by merger, purchase of substantially all of the assets or other reorganization or to a joint venture agreement[, provided that such issuances [are approved by the Requisite Directors] [[do not exceed an aggregate of [______] shares of Common Stock (including shares underlying (directly or indirectly) any such Options or Convertible Securities)];] [or] shares of Common Stock issued in connection with a firm underwritten public offering of the Corporation’s Common Stock pursuant to an effective registration statement; [or] [shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities issued in connection with sponsored research, collaboration, technology license, development, OEM, marketing or other similar agreements or strategic partnerships [approved by the Requisite Directors] [that do not exceed an aggregate of [______] shares of Common Stock (including shares underlying (directly or indirectly) any such Options or Convertible Securities)]. “Convertible Securities” means any evidences of indebtedness, shares or other securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, but excluding Options. “Option” means any rights, options or warrants to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock or Convertible Securities. “Original Issue Date” means the date on which the first share of Series A Preferred Stock is issued. No Adjustment of Preferred Stock Conversion Price. No adjustment in the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if the Corporation receives written notice from [the Requisite Holders] [the holders of [a majority] of the then outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock], agreeing that no such adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.  Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock.  If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities (excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities) or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date. If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 4.4.4, are revised as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this Section 4.4.3(b) shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price applicable to a series of Preferred Stock to an amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the original adjustment made as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security, or (ii) the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock (other than deemed issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security) between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date. If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 4.4.4 (either because the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 4.4.5) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or greater than the applicable Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Original Issue Date), are revised after the Original Issue Date as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such Option or Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended or adjusted, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto determined in the manner provided in Section 4.4.3(a) shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective. Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof) which resulted (either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 4.4.4, the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted to such Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock as would have obtained had such Option or Convertible Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.  If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is calculable at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is potentially subject to adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock provided for in this Section 4.4.3 shall be effected at the time of such issuance or amendment based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any provisions for subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as provided in clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 4.4.3). If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, cannot be calculated at all at the time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended, any adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock that would result under the terms of this Section 4.4.3 at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time such number of shares and/or amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such adjustment to the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can first be made. In the event an Option or Convertible Security contains alternative conversion terms, such as a cap on the valuation of the Corporation at which such conversion will be effected, or circumstances where the Option or Convertible Security may be repaid in lieu of conversion, then the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of such Option or Convertible Security shall be deemed not calculable until such time as the applicable conversion terms are determined. [Use the following Section 4.4.4 if the terms sheet calls for a broad-based weighted average anti-dilution provision] Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4.4.3), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance, then the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) determined in accordance with the following formula: CP2 = CP1* (A + B) / (A + C). For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:  “CP2” shall mean the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately after such issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock; “CP1” shall mean the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock;  “A” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock (treating for this purpose as outstanding all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance or upon conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities (including the Preferred Stock) outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue);  “B” shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been issued or deemed issued at a price per share equal to CP1 (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation in respect of such issue by CP1); and “C” shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock issued in such transaction.

NVCA-Model-COI-10-1-2025_5,NVCA-Model-COI-10-1-2025,"4.4.4	Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. In the event the Corporation at any time after the Original Issue Date [and prior to [Date]] issues Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4.4.3), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance, then the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock shall be reduced, concurrently with such issuance or deemed issuance, to the consideration per share received by the Corporation for such issue or deemed issue of the Additional Shares of Common Stock; provided that if such issuance or deemed issuance was without consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have received an aggregate of [$0.001] of consideration for all such Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued. Determination of Consideration. For purposes of this Section 4.4, the consideration received by the Corporation for the issuance or deemed issuance of any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows: Cash and Property. Such consideration shall: insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable for accrued interest; insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors; and in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Options and Convertible Securities. The consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4.4.3, relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing: The total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, by  the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. Multiple Closing Dates. In the event the Corporation shall issue on more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock that are a part of one transaction or a series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 4.4.4[, and such issuance dates occur within a period of no more than [180] days from the first such issuance to the final such issuance,] then, upon the final such issuance, the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent issuances within such period). Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under this Section 4.5 shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, if such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Price of each such series of Preferred Stock then in effect by a fraction: the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.6 as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (b) no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of such series of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event. Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date the Corporation shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property and the provisions of Section 1 do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and in each such event the holders of Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event. Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.3, if there shall occur any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by Sections 4.4, 4.6 or 4.7), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of such Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Section 4 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 4.8 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.  Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 4, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than ten days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property into which such series of Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than [10] days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (i) the Conversion Price then in effect for each series of Preferred Stock held by such holder, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of each such series of Preferred Stock. Notice of Record Date. In the event: the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or series or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event; or of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Corporation, then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to the holders of the Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share and character of such exchange applicable to the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at least [10] days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.  Mandatory Conversion. Trigger Events. All outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate as calculated pursuant to Sections 4.1.1 and 4.2, upon the earliest to occur of (the time of such conversion is referred to herein as the “Mandatory Conversion Time”): [(i)] immediately prior to the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock to the public [at a price of at least $[_____] per share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Common Stock)], in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, resulting in at least $[______] of [gross] proceeds[, net of the underwriting discount and commissions,] to the Corporation and in connection with such offering the shares of Common Stock are listed for trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the New York Stock Exchange or another exchange or marketplace approved by the [Requisite Directors] (a “Qualified IPO”);  [(ii) immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement in connection with the initial listing of the Common Stock (or other equity securities of the Corporation) on the Nasdaq Stock Market, New York Stock Exchange or another exchange or marketplace approved by the [Requisite Directors] by means of an effective registration statement filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, without a related underwritten offering of such Common Stock (or other equity securities)[, for which the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines that the Corporation is expected to have a market capitalization equal to or greater than $[__________] at any time on the first day of trading] (a “Qualified Direct Listing”);] and the date and time, or upon the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the Requisite Holders.   Procedural Requirements. All holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock (or the applicable series thereof) shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5. Such notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Time. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock being converted that holds such shares of Preferred Stock in certificated form shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so required by the Corporation, any certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 5.1, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the Mandatory Conversion Time (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender any certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of any certificate or certificates of such holders (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive the items provided for in the next sentence of this Section 5.2. As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and, if applicable, the surrender of any certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall (a) issue and deliver to such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof or issue and deliver to such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a notice of issuance of uncertificated shares and may, upon written request, issue and deliver a certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof; and (b) pay any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted. [Use the following Section 5A if the Term Sheet calls for a pay-to-play provision where the penalty is conversion into Common Stock.] Special Mandatory Conversion., Trigger Event. In the event that any holder of shares of Preferred Stock does not participate in a Qualified Financing (as defined below) by purchasing in the aggregate, in such Qualified Financing and within the time period specified by the Corporation (provided that, the Corporation has sent to each holder of Preferred Stock at least 10 days written notice of, and the opportunity to purchase its Pro Rata Amount (as defined below) of, the Qualified Financing), such holder’s Pro Rata Amount, [then each share] [then the Applicable Portion (as defined below) of the shares] of Preferred Stock held by such holder shall automatically, and without any further action on the part of such holder, be converted into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the consummation of such Qualified Financing, effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Qualified Financing. For purposes of determining the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by a holder, and for determining the number of Offered Securities (as defined below) a holder of Preferred Stock has purchased in a Qualified Financing, all shares of Preferred Stock held by Affiliates (as defined below) of such holder shall be aggregated with such holder’s shares and all Offered Securities purchased by Affiliates of such holder shall be aggregated with the Offered Securities purchased by such holder (provided that no shares or securities shall be attributed to more than one entity or person within any such group of affiliated entities or persons). Such conversion is referred to as a “Special Mandatory Conversion.” Procedural Requirements. Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 5A.1 shall be sent written notice of such Special Mandatory Conversion and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5A. Upon receipt of such notice, each holder of such shares of Preferred Stock in certificated form shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that any such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice. If so required by the Corporation, any certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 5A.1, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the time of the Special Mandatory Conversion (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender any certificates for such shares at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of any certificate or certificates of such holders therefor (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement), to receive the items provided for in the next sentence of this Section 5A.2. As soon as practicable after the Special Mandatory Conversion and, if applicable, the surrender of any certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) for Preferred Stock so converted, the Corporation shall (a) [issue and deliver to such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof] and (b) pay any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted [and (c) a new certificate for the number of shares, if any, of Preferred Stock represented by such surrendered certificate and not converted pursuant to Section 5A.1].   Definitions. For purposes of this Section 5A, the following definitions shall apply:  “Affiliate” shall mean, with respect to any holder of shares of Preferred Stock, any person, entity or firm which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such holder, including, without limitation, any entity of which the holder is a partner or member, any partner, officer, director, member or employee of such holder and any venture capital fund or other investment fund now or hereafter existing of which the holder is a partner or member which is controlled by or under common control with one or more general partners, managing members or investment advisors of such holder or shares the same management company or investment advisor with such holder.  [“Applicable Portion” shall mean, with respect to any holder of shares of Preferred Stock, a number of shares of Preferred Stock calculated by multiplying the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder immediately prior to a Qualified Financing by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the amount, if positive, by which such holder’s Pro Rata Amount exceeds the number of Offered Securities actually purchased by such holder in such Qualified Financing, and the denominator of which is equal to such holder’s Pro Rata Amount.] “Offered Securities” shall mean the equity securities of the Corporation set aside by the Board of Directors for purchase by holders of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in connection with a Qualified Financing, and offered to such holders.  “Pro Rata Amount” shall mean, with respect to any holder of Preferred Stock, the lesser of (a) a number of Offered Securities calculated by multiplying the aggregate number of Offered Securities by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to [the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by such holder, and the denominator of which is equal to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock], or (b) the maximum number of Offered Securities that such holder is permitted by the Corporation to purchase in such Qualified Financing, after giving effect to any cutbacks or limitations established by the Board of Directors and applied on a pro rata basis to all holders of Preferred Stock.  “Qualified Financing” shall mean any transaction involving the issuance or sale of Additional Shares of Common Stock after the Original Issue Date [that would result in at least $_______ in gross proceeds to the Corporation, [including/excluding] proceeds previously received by Corporation for debt that is being cancelled or converted in connection with such issuance] [or result in the reduction of the Conversion Price of any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation (without giving effect to the operation of Section 4.4.2]], unless the [Requisite Holders] elect, by written notice sent to the Corporation at least [__] days prior to the consummation of the Qualified Financing, that such transaction not be treated as a Qualified Financing for purposes of this Section 5A.  Redemption. [Other than as set forth in Section 2.3.2(b), the Preferred Stock is not redeemable at the option of the holder or the Corporation.],  [General. Unless prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders, shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation at a price per share of such Preferred Stock equal to [the greater of (A)][the applicable Original Issue Price, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon][and (B) the Fair Market Value (determined in the manner set forth below) of such share of Preferred Stock as of the date of the Corporation’s receipt of the Redemption Request] (the “Redemption Price”), in three annual installments commencing not more than 60 days after receipt by the Corporation at any time on or after [_____________] from the Requisite Holders of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Preferred Stock (the “Redemption Request”). Upon receipt of a Redemption Request, the Corporation shall apply all of its assets to any such redemption, and to no other corporate purpose, except to the extent prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders. [For purposes of this Section 6.1, the Fair Market Value of a single share of Preferred Stock shall be the value of a single share of Preferred Stock as mutually agreed upon by the Corporation and the holders of a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, and, in the event that they are unable to reach agreement, by a third-party appraiser agreed to by the Corporation and the holders of a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding.] The date of each such installment provided in the Redemption Notice (as defined below) shall be referred to as a “Redemption Date.” On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies)[; provided, however, that Excluded Shares (as such term is defined in Section 6.2) shall not be redeemed and shall be excluded from the calculations set forth in this sentence]. If on any Redemption Date Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders prevents the Corporation from redeeming all shares of [the series of] Preferred Stock to be redeemed, the Corporation shall ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may redeem consistent with such law, and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under such law. Redemption Notice. The Corporation shall send written notice of the mandatory redemption (the “Redemption Notice”) to each holder of record of Preferred Stock not less than 40 days prior to each Redemption Date. Each Redemption Notice shall state: the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by the holder that the Corporation shall redeem on the Redemption Date specified in the Redemption Notice; the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price; the date upon which the holder’s right to convert such shares terminates (as determined in accordance with Section 4.1); and for holders of shares in certificated form, that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed. [If the Corporation receives, on or prior to the 20th day after the date of delivery of the Redemption Notice to a holder of Preferred Stock, written notice from such holder that such holder elects to be excluded from the redemption provided in this Section 6, then the shares of Preferred Stock registered on the books of the Corporation in the name of such holder at the time of the Corporation’s receipt of such notice shall thereafter be “Excluded Shares.” Excluded Shares shall not be redeemed or redeemable pursuant to this Section 6, whether on such Redemption Date or thereafter.] Surrender of Certificates; Payment. On or before the applicable Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, unless such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as provided in Section 4, shall, if a holder of shares in certificated form, surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof. In the event less than all of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate, instrument, or book entry representing the unredeemed shares of Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder. Interest. If any shares of Preferred Stock are not redeemed for any reason on any Redemption Date, all such unredeemed shares shall remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided herein, and the Corporation shall pay interest on the Redemption Price applicable to such unredeemed shares at an aggregate per annum rate equal to [12]% (increased by 1% each month following the Redemption Date until the Redemption Price, and any interest thereon, is paid in full), with such interest to accrue daily in arrears and be compounded [annually]; provided, however, that in no event shall such interest exceed the maximum permitted rate of interest under applicable law (the “Maximum Permitted Rate”), provided, however, that the Corporation shall take all such actions as may be necessary, including, without limitation, making any applicable governmental filings, to cause the Maximum Permitted Rate to be the highest possible rate. In the event any provision hereof would result in the rate of interest payable hereunder being in excess of the Maximum Permitted Rate, the amount of interest required to be paid hereunder shall automatically be reduced to eliminate such excess; provided, however, that any subsequent increase in the Maximum Permitted Rate shall be retroactively effective to the applicable Redemption Date to the extent permitted by law. Rights Subsequent to Redemption. If the Redemption Notice shall have been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor in a timely manner, then notwithstanding that any certificates evidencing any of the shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of any such certificate or certificates therefor.] Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares. Unless approved by the Board of Directors and the Requisite Holders, any shares of Preferred Stock that are redeemed, converted or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be automatically and immediately cancelled and retired and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred. Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other rights granted to the holders of Preferred Stock following redemption, conversion or acquisition. The Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock accordingly. Waiver.

Prepayment of Expenses of Directors and Officers. The Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Indemnified Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article Tenth or otherwise. Claims by Directors and Officers. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article Tenth is not paid in full within 30 days after a written claim therefor by the Indemnified Person has been received by the Corporation, the Indemnified Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may indemnify and advance expenses to any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal representative, is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or, while an employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such person if the Proceeding was not authorized in advance by the Board of Directors. Advancement of Expenses of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may pay the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an employee or agent in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Board of Directors. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Article Tenth shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Corporation, or any agreement, or pursuant to any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Other Indemnification. The Corporation’s obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer or employee of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, organization or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, organization or other enterprise. Insurance. The Board of Directors may, to the full extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists, or may hereafter be amended from time to time, authorize an appropriate officer or officers to purchase and maintain at the Corporation’s expense insurance: (a) to indemnify the Corporation for any obligation which it incurs as a result of the indemnification of directors, officers and employees under the provisions of this Article Tenth; and (b) to indemnify or insure directors, officers and employees against liability in instances in which they may not otherwise be indemnified by the Corporation under the provisions of this Article Tenth. Amendment or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article Tenth shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (i) during the period that is 60 days before the Company’s good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date that is 180 days after the effective date of, a Company-initiated registration, provided that the Company is actively employing in good faith commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective; (ii) after the Company has effected [one to two] registration[s] pursuant to Section 2.1(a); or (iii) if the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of shares of Registrable Securities that may be immediately registered on Form S-3 pursuant to a request made pursuant to Section 2.1(b).

A registration shall not be counted as “effected” for purposes of this Section 2.1(d) until such time as the applicable registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC, unless the Initiating Holders withdraw their request for such registration, elect not to pay the registration expenses therefor, and forfeit their right to one demand registration statement pursuant to Section 2.6, in which case such withdrawn registration statement shall be counted as “effected” for purposes of this Section 2.1(d); provided, that if such withdrawal is during a period the Company has deferred taking action pursuant to Section 2.1(c), then the Initiating Holders may withdraw their request for registration and such registration will not be counted as “effected” for purposes of this Section 2.1(d). Company Registration . If the Company proposes to register (including for this purpose a registration effected by the Company for stockholders other than the Holders) any of its Common Stock under the Securities Act in connection with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other than in an Excluded Registration or a registration pursuant to Section 2.1), the Company shall, at such time, promptly give each Holder notice of such registration. Upon the request of each Holder given within 20 days after such notice is given by the Company, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of Section 2.3, cause to be registered all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be included in such registration. The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 2.2 before the effective date of such registration, whether or not any Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration. The expenses (other than Selling Expenses) of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Section 2.6. Underwriting Requirements. If, pursuant to Section 2.1, the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to Section 2.1, and the Company shall include such information in the Demand Notice. The underwriter(s) will be selected by the [Company][Board of Directors] and shall be reasonably acceptable to a majority in interest of the Initiating Holders. In such event, the right of any Holder to include such Holder’s Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder’s participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder’s Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the Company as provided in Section 2.4(e)) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter(s) selected for such underwriting[; provided, however, that no Holder (or any of their assignees) shall be required to make any representations, warranties or indemnities except as they relate to such Holder’s ownership of shares and authority to enter into the underwriting agreement and to such Holder’s intended method of distribution, and the liability of such Holder shall be several and not joint, and limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder]. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.3, if the [managing] underwriter(s) advise(s) the Initiating Holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, then the Initiating Holders shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities that otherwise would be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of Registrable Securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among such Holders of Registrable Securities, including the Initiating Holders, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the number of Registrable Securities owned by each Holder or in such other proportion as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders; provided, however, that the number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders to be included in such underwriting shall not be reduced unless all other securities are first entirely excluded from the underwriting. To facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above provisions, the Company or the underwriters may round the number of shares allocated to any Holder to the nearest 100 shares. In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Company’s capital stock pursuant to Section 2.2, the Company shall not be required to include any of the Holders’ Registrable Securities in such underwriting unless the Holders accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and its underwriters, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the Company. If the total number of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the number of securities to be sold (other than by the Company) that the underwriters in their reasonable discretion determine is compatible with the success of the offering, then the Company shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters and the Company in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering. If the underwriters determine that less than all of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered can be included in such offering, then the Registrable Securities that are included in such offering shall be allocated among the selling Holders in proportion (as nearly as practicable to) the number of Registrable Securities owned by each selling Holder or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Holders. To facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above provisions, the Company or the underwriters may round the number of shares allocated to any Holder to the nearest 100 shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall (i) the number of Registrable Securities included in the offering be reduced unless all other securities (other than securities to be sold by the Company) are first entirely excluded from the offering, [or] (ii) the number of Registrable Securities included in the offering be reduced below [20-30]% of the total number of securities included in such offering, unless such offering is the IPO, in which case the selling Holders may be excluded further if the underwriters make the determination described above and no other stockholder’s securities are included in such offering [or (iii) notwithstanding (ii) above, any Registrable Securities which are not Key Holder Registrable Securities be excluded from such underwriting unless all Key Holder Registrable Securities are first excluded from such offering]. For purposes of the provision in this Section 2.3(b) concerning apportionment, for any selling Holder that is a partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the partners, members, retired partners, retired members, stockholders, and Affiliates of such Holder, or the estates and Immediate Family Members of any such partners, retired partners, members, and retired members and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing Persons, shall be deemed to be a single “selling Holder,” and any pro rata reduction with respect to such “selling Holder” shall be based upon the aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned by all Persons included in such “selling Holder,” as defined in this sentence. For purposes of Section 2.1, a registration shall not be counted as “effected” if, as a result of an exercise of the underwriter’s cutback provisions in Section 2.3(a), fewer than 50% of the total number of Registrable Securities that Holders have requested to be included in such registration statement are actually included. Obligations of the Company . Whenever required under this Section 2 to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and, upon the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for a period of up to 120 days or, if earlier, until the distribution contemplated in the registration statement has been completed; provided, however, that (i) such 120-day period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the Holder refrains, at the request of an underwriter of Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company, from selling any securities included in such registration, and (ii) in the case of any registration of Registrable Securities on Form S-3 that are intended to be offered on a continuous or delayed basis, subject to compliance with applicable SEC rules, such 120-day period shall be extended for up to an additional 90 days, if necessary, to keep the registration statement effective until all such Registrable Securities are sold; prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement, and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement, as may be necessary to comply with the Securities Act in order to enable the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement; furnish to the selling Holders such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, as required by the Securities Act, and such other documents as the Holders may reasonably request in order to facilitate their disposition of their Registrable Securities; use its commercially reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue-sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the selling Holders; provided that the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities Act; in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the underwriter(s) of such offering; use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement to be listed on a national securities exchange or trading system and each securities exchange and trading system (if any) on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed; provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Agreement and provide a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of such registration; promptly make available for inspection by the selling Holders, any [managing] underwriter(s) participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney or accountant or other agent retained by any such underwriter or selected by the selling Holders, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents, and properties of the Company, and cause the Company’s officers, directors, employees, and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant, or agent, in each case, as necessary or advisable to verify the accuracy of the information in such registration statement and to conduct appropriate due diligence in connection therewith; notify each selling Holder, promptly after the Company receives notice thereof, of the time when such registration statement has been declared effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such registration statement has been filed; and after such registration statement becomes effective, notify each selling Holder of any request by the SEC that the Company amend or supplement such registration statement or prospectus. In addition, the Company shall ensure that, at all times after any registration statement covering a public offering of securities of the Company under the Securities Act shall have become effective, its insider trading policy shall provide that the Company’s directors may implement a trading program under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. Furnish Information . It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to this Section 2 with respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as is reasonably required to effect the registration of such Holder’s Registrable Securities. Expenses of Registration . All expenses (other than Selling Expenses) incurred in connection with registrations, filings, or qualifications pursuant to Section 2, including all registration, filing, and qualification fees; printers’ and accounting fees; fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; and the reasonable fees and disbursements[, not to exceed $[50,000] [per registration],] of one counsel for the selling Holders selected by Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be registered (“Selling Holder Counsel”), shall be borne and paid by the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to Section 2.1 if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be registered (in which case all selling Holders shall bear such expenses pro rata based upon the number of Registrable Securities that were to be included in the withdrawn registration), unless the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities agree to forfeit their right to one registration pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) or 2.1(b), as the case may be; provided further that if, at the time of such withdrawal, the Holders shall have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business, or prospects of the Company from that known to the Holders at the time of their request and have withdrawn the request with reasonable promptness after learning of such information then the Holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall not forfeit their right to one registration pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) or 2.1(b). All Selling Expenses relating to Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Section 2 [(other than fees and disbursements of counsel to any Holder, other than the Selling Holder Counsel, which shall be borne solely by the Holder engaging such counsel)] shall be borne and paid by the Holders pro rata on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities registered on their behalf. Delay of Registration . No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any registration pursuant to this Agreement as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this Section 2. Indemnification . If any Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement under this Section 2 [or in connection with a Direct Listing, as applicable]: To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each selling Holder, and the partners, members, officers, directors, and stockholders of each such Holder; legal counsel and accountants for each such Holder; any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for each such Holder; and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any Damages, and the Company will pay to each such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating or defending any claim or proceeding from which Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.8(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall the Company be liable for any Damages to the extent that they arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of any such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person expressly for use in connection with such registration [except to the extent such information has been corrected in a subsequent writing [at least one business day] prior to the sale of Registrable Securities to the Person asserting the claim]. To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each Person (if any), who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, legal counsel and accountants for the Company, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), any other Holder selling securities in such registration statement, and any controlling Person of any such underwriter or other Holder, against any Damages, in each case only to the extent that such Damages arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of such selling Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration [and that has not been corrected in a subsequent writing [at least one business day] prior to the sale of Registrable Securities to the Person asserting the claim]; and each such selling Holder will pay to the Company and each other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating or defending any claim or proceeding from which Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.8(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided further that in no event shall the aggregate amounts payable by any Holder by way of indemnity or contribution under Sections 2.8(b) and 2.8(d) exceed the proceeds from the offering received by such Holder (net of any Selling Expenses paid by such Holder), except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct by such Holder. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.8 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action) for which a party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 2.8, give the indemnifying party notice of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in such action and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, participate jointly with any other indemnifying party to which notice has been given, and to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such action. [The failure to give notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 2.8, [only] to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party’s ability to defend such action. The failure to give notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 2.8.] To provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either: (i) any party otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 2.8 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case, notwithstanding the fact that this Section 2.8 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any party hereto for which indemnification is provided under this Section 2.8, then, and in each such case, such parties will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of each of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements, omissions, or other actions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability, or expense, as well as to reflect any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact, or the omission or alleged omission of a material fact, relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however, that, in any such case (x) no Holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such Registrable Securities offered and sold by such Holder pursuant to such registration statement, and (y) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and provided further that in no event shall a Holder’s liability pursuant to this Section 2.8(d), when combined with the amounts paid or payable by such Holder pursuant to Section 2.8(b), exceed the proceeds from the offering received by such Holder (net of any Selling Expenses paid by such Holder), except in the case of willful misconduct or fraud by such Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control; provided, however, that any matter expressly provided for or addressed by the provisions of this Section 2.8 that is not expressly provided for or addressed by the underwriting agreement shall be controlled by the foregoing provisions. Unless otherwise superseded by an underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering, the obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 2.8 shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration under this Section 2, and otherwise shall survive the termination of this Agreement or any provision(s) of this Agreement. Reports Under Exchange Act . With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of SEC Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit a Holder to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3, the Company shall: make and keep available adequate current public information, as those terms are understood and defined in SEC Rule 144, at all times after the effective date of the registration statement filed by the Company for the IPO[ or Direct Listing, as applicable]; use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after the Company has become subject to such reporting requirements); and furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request (i) to the extent accurate, a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of SEC Rule 144 (at any time after 90 days after the effective date of the registration statement filed by the Company for the IPO[ or Direct Listing, as applicable]), the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act (at any time after the Company has become subject to such reporting requirements), or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after the Company so qualifies); and (ii) such other information as may be reasonably requested in availing any Holder of any rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any such securities without registration (at any time after the Company has become subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act) or pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after the Company so qualifies to use such form). Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights . From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Requisite Holders, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company that would (i) [provide to such holder or prospective holder the right to include securities in any registration on other than either a pro rata basis with respect to the Registrable Securities or on a subordinate basis after all Holders have had the opportunity to include in the registration and offering all shares of Registrable Securities that they wish to so include]/[allow such holder or prospective holder to include such securities in any registration unless, under the terms of such agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in any such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of such securities will not reduce the number of the Registrable Securities of the Holders that are included]; or (ii) allow such holder or prospective holder to initiate a demand for registration of any securities held by such holder or prospective holder; provided that this limitation shall not apply to Registrable Securities acquired by any additional Investor that becomes a party to this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.9. “Market Stand-off” Agreement . Each Holder hereby agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the managing underwriter, during the period commencing on the date of the final prospectus relating to the registration by the Company for its own behalf of shares of its Common Stock or any other equity securities under the Securities Act on a registration statement (other than an Excluded Registration) on Form S-1 [or Form S-3], and ending on the date specified by the Company and the managing underwriter (such period not to exceed 180 days in the case of the IPO [or 90 days in the case of any registration other than the IPO] [or, if the Company is not then an emerging growth company as defined in the applicable SEC regulations, such other period as may be requested by the Company or an underwriter to accommodate regulatory restrictions on (1) the publication or other distribution of research reports and (2) analyst recommendations and opinions, including, but not limited to, the restrictions contained in applicable FINRA rules, or any successor provisions or amendments thereto]), (i) lend; offer; pledge; sell; contract to sell; sell any option or contract to purchase; purchase any option or contract to sell; grant any option, right, or warrant to purchase; or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable (directly or indirectly) for Common Stock held immediately before the effective date of the registration statement for such offering or (ii) enter into any swap, hedging, or other transaction or arrangement that transfers, or is designed to transfer, to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership, directly or indirectly, of such securities, whether or not any such transaction or arrangement described in clauses (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or other securities, in cash, or otherwise. The foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11 [shall apply only to the IPO,] shall not apply to the sale of any shares to an underwriter pursuant to an underwriting agreement [or to the establishment of a trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1, provided that such plan does not permit transfers during the restricted period ], [or the transfer of any shares to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the Holder or one or more of the Holder’s Immediate Family Members, provided that the trustee of the trust agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value,] and shall be applicable to the Holders only if all officers and directors of the Company are subject to the same restrictions and the Company uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a similar agreement from all stockholders individually owning more than [1-3]% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock (after giving effect to the conversion into Common Stock of all outstanding Preferred Stock). The underwriters in connection with such registration are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section 2.11 and shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto. Each Holder further agrees to execute such agreements as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters in connection with such registration that are consistent with this Section 2.11. [Any discretionary waiver or termination of the restrictions of any or all of such agreements by the Company or the underwriters shall apply pro rata to all Company stockholders that are subject to such agreements, based on the number of shares subject to such agreements[, except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the underwriters may, in their sole discretion, waive or terminate these restrictions with respect to up to [___] shares of the Common Stock].] Restrictions on Transfer . The Preferred Stock and the Registrable Securities shall not be sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred, and the Company shall not recognize and shall issue stop-transfer instructions to its transfer agent with respect to any such sale, pledge, or transfer, except upon the conditions specified in this Agreement, which conditions are intended to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act and all other applicable U.S. laws and regulations. A transferring Holder will cause any proposed purchaser, pledgee, or transferee of the Preferred Stock and the Registrable Securities held by such Holder to agree to take and hold such securities subject to the provisions and upon the conditions specified in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not require any transferee of shares pursuant to an effective registration statement or, following the IPO [or Direct Listing, as applicable], SEC Rule 144, in each case, to be bound by the terms of this Section 2.12.  Each certificate, instrument, or book entry representing (i) the Preferred Stock, (ii) the Registrable Securities, and (iii) any other securities issued in respect of the securities referenced in clauses (i) and (ii), upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, or similar event, shall (unless otherwise permitted by the provisions of Section 2.12(c)) be notated with a legend substantially in the following form:  THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR A VALID EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE STOCKHOLDER, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY. The Holders consent to the Company making a notation in its records and giving instructions to any transfer agent of the Restricted Securities in order to implement the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 2.12. The holder of such Restricted Securities, by acceptance of ownership thereof, agrees to comply in all respects with the provisions of this Section 2. Before any proposed sale, pledge, or transfer of any Restricted Securities, unless there is in effect a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the proposed transaction [or following the IPO [or Direct Listing, as applicable], the transfer is made pursuant to SEC Rule 144], the Holder thereof shall give notice to the Company of such Holder’s intention to effect such sale, pledge, or transfer, provided that no such notice shall be required in connection if the intended sale, pledge or transfer complies with SEC Rule 144. Each such notice shall describe the manner and circumstances of the proposed sale, pledge, or transfer in sufficient detail and, if reasonably requested by the Company, shall be accompanied at such Holder’s expense by either (i) a written opinion of legal counsel who shall, and whose legal opinion shall, be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, addressed to the Company, to the effect that the proposed transaction may be effected without registration under the Securities Act; (ii) a “no action” letter from the SEC to the effect that the proposed sale, pledge, or transfer of such Restricted Securities without registration will not result in a recommendation by the staff of the SEC that action be taken with respect thereto; or (iii) any other evidence reasonably satisfactory to counsel to the Company to the effect that the proposed sale, pledge, or transfer of the Restricted Securities may be effected without registration under the Securities Act, whereupon the Holder of such Restricted Securities shall be entitled to sell, pledge, or transfer such Restricted Securities in accordance with the terms of the notice given by the Holder to the Company. The Company will not require such a notice, legal opinion or “no action” letter (x) in any transaction in compliance with SEC Rule 144; or (y) in any transaction in which such Holder distributes Restricted Securities to an Affiliate of such Holder for no consideration; provided that with respect to transfers under the foregoing clause (y), each transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms of this Section 2.12. Each certificate, instrument, or book entry representing the Restricted Securities transferred as above provided shall be notated with, except if such transfer is made pursuant to SEC Rule 144, the appropriate restrictive legend set forth in Section 2.12(b), except that such certificate, instrument, or book entry shall not be notated with such restrictive legend if, in the opinion of counsel for such Holder and the Company, such legend is not required in order to establish compliance with any provisions of the Securities Act and the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such legend to be removed. Termination and Suspension of Registration Rights . The right of any Holder to request registration or inclusion of Registrable Securities in any registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2 shall terminate, as to such Holder, upon [the earliest to occur of]: [the closing of a Deemed Liquidation Event [in which (x) the consideration received by the Investors in such Deemed Liquidation Event is in the form of cash and/or publicly traded securities, or (y) if the Investors receive registration rights from the acquiring company or other successor to the Company reasonably comparable to those set forth in this Section 2]; [and]] [such time after consummation of an IPO [or Direct Listing, whichever is earlier], when the Holder (A) together with its “affiliates” (as determined under SEC Rule 144) holds less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company and (B) may immediately sell all of the Holder’s Registrable Securities under SEC Rule 144 without volume limitation, or another similar exemption under the Securities Act is available for the sale of all of such Holder’s shares without limitation, during a three-month period without registration;] [and]36 the [third to fifth] anniversary of the IPO[ or Direct Listing, as applicable][, or such later date that is 180 days following the expiration of all deferrals of the Company’s obligations pursuant to Section 2 that remain in effect as of such anniversary]. The right of any Holder to request registration or inclusion of Registrable Securities in any registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2 shall be suspended during any time as such Holder is a Sanctioned Party. Information [and Observer] Rights. Delivery of Financial Statements .  The Company shall deliver to each Major Investor[, provided that such Major Investor is not a Competitor]: as soon as practicable, but in any event within 180 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company (A) a balance sheet as of the end of such year, (B) statements of income and of cash flows for such year[, and a comparison between (x) the actual amounts as of and for such fiscal year and (y) the comparable amounts for the prior year and as included in the Approved Annual Budget (as defined below) for such year, with an explanation of any material differences between such amounts and a schedule as to the sources and applications of funds for such year], and (C) a statement of stockholders’ equity as of the end of such year, all such financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP [and audited and certified by independent public accountants of [nationally][regionally] recognized standing selected by the Company]; as soon as practicable, but in any event within 45 days after the end of each quarter of each fiscal year of the Company, unaudited statements of income and cash flows for such fiscal quarter, and an unaudited balance sheet [and a statement of stockholders’ equity] as of the end of such fiscal quarter, all prepared in accordance with GAAP (except that such financial statements may (A) be subject to normal year-end audit adjustments; and (B) not contain all notes thereto that may be required in accordance with GAAP); as soon as practicable, but in any event within 45 days after the end of each quarter of each fiscal year of the Company, a statement showing the number of shares of each class and series of capital stock and securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of capital stock outstanding at the end of the period, the Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of any outstanding securities convertible or exercisable for Common Stock and the exchange ratio or exercise price applicable thereto, and the number of shares of issued stock options and stock options not yet issued but reserved for issuance, if any, all in sufficient detail as to permit the Major Investors to calculate their respective percentage equity ownership in the Company; [and] [as soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the end of each month, an unaudited income statement [and statement of cash flows] for such month, and an unaudited balance sheet [and statement of stockholders’ equity] as of the end of such month, all prepared in accordance with GAAP (except that such financial statements may (A) be subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and (B) not contain all notes thereto that may be required in accordance with GAAP); and] as soon as practicable, the Approved Annual Budget. The Company shall[, at least 30 days before the end of each fiscal year,] prepare an annual budget and business plan for the next fiscal year, prepared on a monthly basis, including balance sheets, income statements, and statements of cash flow for such months (the “Budget”). The Company shall submit the Budget to the Board of Directors for approval and the Budget, as may be revised by the Board of Directors, shall be approved by the Board of Directors (“Approved Annual Budget”).  If, for any period, the Company has any subsidiary whose accounts are consolidated with those of the Company, then in respect of such period the financial statements delivered pursuant to the foregoing sections shall be the consolidated and consolidating financial statements of the Company and all such consolidated subsidiaries. If reasonably requested by a Major Investor, the Company shall provide the information required by, or reasonably requested pursuant to, this Section 3.1 to such Major Investor by uploading the information to a portfolio management platform. Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 3.1 to the contrary, the Company may cease providing the information set forth in this Section 3.1 during the period starting with the date [30-60] days before the Company’s good-faith estimate of the date of filing of a registration statement if it reasonably concludes it must do so to comply with the SEC rules applicable to such registration statement and related offering; provided that the Company’s covenants under this Section 3.1 shall be reinstated at such time as the Company is no longer actively employing its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective. Inspection . The Company shall permit each Major Investor [(provided that the Board of Directors has not reasonably determined that such Major Investor is a Competitor)], at such Major Investor’s expense, to visit and inspect the Company’s properties; examine its books of account and records; and discuss the Company’s affairs, finances, and accounts with its officers, during normal business hours of the Company as may be reasonably requested by the Major Investor in connection with monitoring or making decisions with respect to its investment in the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section 3.2 to (a) create any new information or materials or (b) provide access to any information that it reasonably and in good faith considers to be a trade secret or confidential information or the disclosure of which would adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel.

The covenants set forth in Sections 3.1[,][and] 3.2 [and 3.3] shall terminate and be of no further force or effect (i) immediately before the consummation of the IPO [or Direct Listing, as applicable]; (ii) with respect to any Investor that is or becomes a Sanctioned Party, for so long as such Investor is a Sanctioned Party; [or] (iii) when the Company first becomes subject to the periodic reporting requirements of Section 12(g) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, [or (iv) upon the closing of a Deemed Liquidation Event, whichever event occurs first; provided, that, with respect to clause (iv), the covenants set forth in Section 3.1 shall only terminate if the consideration received by the Investors in such Deemed Liquidation Event is in the form of cash and/or publicly traded securities or if the Investors receive financial information from the acquiring company or other successor to the Company comparable to those set forth in Section 3.1]. Confidentiality . Each Investor agrees that such Investor will keep confidential and will not disclose, divulge, or use for any purpose (other than to monitor or make decisions with respect to its investment in the Company) any confidential information obtained from the Company (including notice of the Company’s intention to file a registration statement), unless such confidential information (a) is known or becomes known to the public in general (other than as a result of a breach of this Section 3.5 by such Investor), (b) is or has been independently developed or conceived by such Investor without use of the Company’s confidential information, or (c) is or has been made known or disclosed to such Investor by a third party without a breach of any obligation of confidentiality such third party may have to the Company; provided, however, that an Investor may disclose confidential information (i) to its attorneys, accountants, consultants, and other professionals to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain their services in connection with monitoring its investment in the Company; (ii) to any prospective purchaser of any Registrable Securities from such Investor, if such prospective purchaser agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 3.5; (iii) to any [existing or prospective] Affiliate, partner, member, stockholder, or wholly owned subsidiary of such Investor in the ordinary course of business, provided that such Investor informs such Person that such information is confidential and directs such Person to maintain the confidentiality of such information; or (iv) as may otherwise be required by law, regulation, rule, court order or subpoena, provided that such Investor promptly notifies the Company of such disclosure and takes reasonable steps to minimize the extent of any such required disclosure. [Limitation on Foreign Person Investors . Notwithstanding the covenants set forth in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, the Company shall not provide any Investor that is a Foreign Person access to any “material non-public technical information” within the meaning of the DPA.] Waiver of Statutory Information Rights . Each Investor hereby acknowledges and agrees that until the consummation of the [earlier of the ]IPO[ or Direct Listing, as applicable], such Investor shall hereby be deemed to have unconditionally and irrevocably, to the fullest extent permitted by law, on behalf of such Investor and all beneficial owners of the shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock owned by such Investor (a “Beneficial Owner”), waived, and does hereby so waive, any rights such Investor or a Beneficial Owner might otherwise have had under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (or under similar rights under other applicable law) to inspect for any proper purpose and to make copies and extracts from the Company’s stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records or the books and records of any subsidiary. This waiver applies only in such Investor’s capacity as a stockholder and does not affect any other information and inspection rights such Investor may expressly have pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2, or 3.7(b) of this Agreement. Each Investor hereby further warrants and represents that such Investor has reviewed this waiver with its legal counsel, and that such Investor knowingly and voluntarily waives its rights as a stockholder otherwise provided by Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (or under similar rights under other applicable law).  Within 15 days after request by any Investor that is not a Major Investor (but no more frequently than once per each quarter of each fiscal year of the Company), the Company shall deliver to such requesting Investor a statement showing the number of shares of each class and series of capital stock and securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of capital stock outstanding at the end of the period, the Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of any outstanding securities convertible or exercisable for Common Stock and the exchange ratio or exercise price applicable thereto, and the number of shares of issued stock options and stock options not yet issued but reserved for issuance, if any, all in sufficient detail as to permit the relevant Investors to calculate its respective percentage equity ownership in the Company. Rights to Future Stock Issuances. Right of First Offer . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 4.1 and applicable securities laws, if the Company proposes to offer or sell any New Securities, the Company shall first offer such New Securities to each Major Investor. A Major Investor shall be entitled to apportion the right of first offer hereby granted to it in such proportions as it deems appropriate, among (i) itself, (ii) its Affiliates and (iii) its beneficial interest holders, such as limited partners, members or any other Person having “beneficial ownership,” as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, of such Major Investor (“Investor Beneficial Owners”); provided that each such Affiliate or Investor Beneficial Owner (x) is not a Competitor [or FOIA Party], unless such party’s purchase of New Securities is otherwise consented to by the Board of Directors, and (y) enters into this Agreement and the [Amended and Restated] Voting Agreement of even date herewith among the Company, the Investors and the other parties named therein, as amended and/or restated from time to time (the “Voting Agreement”), as an “Investor” under each such agreement (provided that any Competitor [or FOIA Party] shall not be entitled to any rights as a Major Investor under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 4.1 hereof) [and provided that the Company shall not be obligated to offer or sell any New Securities to any person or entity that is a Sanctioned Party]. The Company shall give notice (the “Offer Notice”) to each Major Investor, stating (i) its bona fide intention to offer such New Securities, (ii) the number of such New Securities to be offered, and (iii) the price and terms, if any, upon which it proposes to offer such New Securities. By notification to the Company within 20 days after the Offer Notice is given, each Major Investor may elect to purchase or otherwise acquire, at the price and on the terms specified in the Offer Notice, up to that portion of such New Securities which equals the proportion that (x) the Common Stock then held by such Major Investor (including all shares of Common Stock then issuable (directly or indirectly) upon conversion and/or exercise, as applicable, of the Preferred Stock and any other Derivative Securities then held by such Major Investor) bears to (y) the total Common Stock of the Company then outstanding (assuming full conversion and/or exercise, as applicable, of all Preferred Stock and any other Derivative Securities then outstanding). At the expiration of such 20 day period, the Company shall promptly notify each Major Investor that elects to purchase or acquire all the shares available to it (each, a “Fully Exercising Investor”) of any other Major Investor’s failure to do likewise. During the ten-day period commencing after the Company has given such notice, each Fully Exercising Investor may, by giving notice to the Company, elect to purchase or acquire, in addition to the number of shares specified above, up to that portion of the New Securities for which Major Investors were entitled to subscribe but that were not subscribed for by the Major Investors which is equal to the proportion that the Common Stock issued and held, or issuable (directly or indirectly) upon conversion and/or exercise, as applicable, of Preferred Stock and any other Derivative Securities then held, by such Fully Exercising Investor bears to the Common Stock issued and held, or issuable (directly or indirectly) upon conversion and/or exercise, as applicable, of the Preferred Stock and any other Derivative Securities then held, by all Fully Exercising Investors who wish to purchase such unsubscribed shares. The closing of any sale pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) shall occur within the later of [90-120] days of the date that the Offer Notice is given and the date of initial sale of New Securities pursuant to Section 4.1(c). If all New Securities referred to in the Offer Notice are not elected to be purchased or acquired as provided in Section 4.1(b), the Company may, during the [90-120] day period following the expiration of the periods provided in Section 4.1(b), offer and sell the remaining unsubscribed portion of such New Securities to any Person or Persons at a price not less than, and upon terms no more favorable to the offeree than, those specified in the Offer Notice. If the Company does not enter into an agreement for the sale of the New Securities within such period, or if such agreement is not consummated within [30] days of the execution thereof, the right provided hereunder shall be deemed to be revived and such New Securities shall not be offered unless first reoffered to the Major Investors in accordance with this Section 4.1. The right of first offer in this Section 4.1 shall not be applicable to (i) Exempted Securities (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation); [and] (ii) shares of Common Stock issued in the IPO[; and (iii) the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement]. [The right of first offer set forth in this Section 4.1 shall terminate with respect to any Major Investor who fails to purchase, in any transaction subject to this Section 4.1, all of such Major Investor’s pro rata amount of the New Securities allocated (or, if less than such Major Investor’s pro rata amount is offered by the Company, such lesser amount so offered) to such Major Investor pursuant to this Section 4.1. Following any such termination, such Investor shall no longer be deemed a “Major Investor” for any purpose of this Section 4.1] [Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, in lieu of complying with the provisions of this Section 4.1, the Company may elect to give notice to the Major Investors within 30 days after the issuance of New Securities. Such notice shall describe the type, price, and terms of the New Securities. Each Major Investor shall have 20 days from the date notice is given to elect to purchase up to the number of New Securities that would, if purchased by such Major Investor, maintain such Major Investor’s percentage ownership position, calculated as set forth in Section 4.1(b) before giving effect to the issuance of such New Securities.] Termination . The covenants set forth in Section 4.1 shall terminate and be of no further force or effect (i) immediately before the consummation of the IPO[ or Direct Listing, as applicable], or (ii) upon the closing of a Deemed Liquidation Event [in which the consideration received by the Investors in such Deemed Liquidation Event is in the form of cash and/or publicly traded securities, or if the Investors receive participation rights from the acquiring company or other successor to the Company reasonably comparable to those set forth in this Section 4] whichever event occurs first [and, as to each Major Investor, in accordance with Section 4.1(e)]. Additional Covenants. Insurance . The Company [shall obtain, within 90 days of the date hereof, from financially sound and reputable insurers, Directors and Officers liability insurance [and term “key person” insurance on [_____], each] in an amount [not less than $______] and on terms and conditions approved by the Board of Directors and] will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such insurance policies to be maintained until such time as the Board of Directors determines that such insurance should be discontinued. [The key person policy shall name the Company as loss payee]. No such policy shall be cancelable by the Company without prior approval by the Board of Directors. [Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.1 to the contrary, during such time(s) as one or more directors elected by holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock is serving on the Board of Directors, the Company  shall upon request from any such holder deliver to each such holder a certification that such a Directors and Officers liability insurance policy remains in effect.] Employee Agreements . Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors, the Company (a) will cause each Person now or hereafter employed by it or by any subsidiary (or engaged by the Company or any subsidiary as a consultant/independent contractor) with access to confidential information and/or trade secrets to enter into a nondisclosure, proprietary rights assignment agreement[ and, to the extent legally permissible, non-competition and non-solicitation agreement]; [and] (b) shall not amend, modify, terminate, waive, or otherwise alter, in whole or in part, any of the above-referenced agreements or any restricted stock agreement between the Company and any employee[.][; and (c) shall not enter into or give effect to any severance plan, arrangement, agreement, or obligation that may result in payments by the Company of over $[200,000] to any individual]. [Qualified Small Business Stock . The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to refrain from taking any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the shares of [[Series [___]] Preferred Stock [originally issued by the Company to the Investors]], as well as any shares into which such shares are converted, within the meaning of Section 1202(f) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), to fail to qualify as “qualified small business stock” as defined in Section 1202(c) of the Code; provided, however, that such requirement shall not be applicable if the Board of Directors determines, in its good-faith business judgment, that such qualification is inconsistent with the best interests of the Company. The Company shall submit to the Investors and to the Internal Revenue Service any reports that may be required under Section 1202(d)(1)(C) of the Code. In addition, within 20 business days after any Investor’s written request therefor, the Company shall deliver to such Investor a checklist in substantially the same form as Annex 1. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of any such checklist, but in no event shall the Company be liable to the Investors or any other person for any damages arising from any errors or inaccuracies in such report or checklist, unless made by the Company in a manner either grossly negligent or fraudulent.] [Board Attendance Expenses . The Company shall reimburse the directors for all reasonable out-of-pocket travel expenses incurred (consistent with the Company’s travel policy) in connection with attending meetings of the Board of Directors.] Successor Indemnification . If the Company or any of its successors or assignees consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, then to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assignees of the Company assume the obligations of the Company with respect to indemnification of members of the Board of Directors as in effect immediately before such transaction, whether such obligations are contained in the Company’s Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation, or elsewhere, as the case may be. [Expenses of Counsel and Transaction Assistance in an IPO and Sale of the Company .  Expense Reimbursement. In the event of an IPO or a transaction that is a Sale of the Company (as defined in the Voting Agreement of even date herewith among the Investors, the Company and the other parties named therein) (each, a “Reimbursed Transaction”), the reasonable fees and disbursements, not to exceed $[150,000] in the aggregate, of one counsel for the Investors (“Investor Counsel”), solely in their capacities as stockholders, shall be borne and paid by the Company for each Reimbursed Transaction.  Sale of the Company. At the outset of considering a transaction, which if consummated would constitute a Sale of the Company, the Company shall obtain the ability to share with the Investor Counsel (and such counsel’s clients) and shall share the confidential information (including, without limitation, the initial and all subsequent drafts of memoranda of understanding, letters of intent and other transaction documents and related noncompete, employment, consulting and other compensation agreements and plans) pertaining to and memorializing any of the transactions, which, individually or when aggregated with others, would constitute the Sale of the Company. The Company shall be obligated to share (and cause the Company’s counsel and investment bankers to share) such materials when distributed to the Company’s executives and/or any one or more of the other parties to such transaction(s). IPO. If in connection with the IPO the underwriters or the Company request the execution of additional agreements pursuant to Section 2.11, the Company shall share (and cause the Company’s underwriters or their counsel to share) the form of such agreement with the Investor Counsel no less than ten days prior to the deadline for execution such agreement, and in any event, no later than 20 days prior to the first public filing of a registration statement in connection with the IPO. [The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide ten days’ advanced written notice to Investor Counsel of any deadlines for written information that may be required by the Company to be furnished or reviewed by or on behalf of any Holder to be used in connection with the IPO (e.g., information relating to beneficial ownership, director biographies, and summaries of material contracts to which Holder is a party)].  Joint Defense/Common Interest Agreement. In the event that Investor Counsel deems it appropriate, in its reasonable discretion, to enter into a joint defense/common interest agreement or other arrangement to enhance the ability of the parties to protect their communications and other reviewed materials under the attorney client privilege, the Company shall, and shall direct its counsel to, execute and deliver to Investor Counsel and its clients such an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Investor Counsel and the Company’s counsel. In the event that one or more of the other party or parties to such transactions require the clients of Investor Counsel to enter into a confidentiality agreement and/or joint defense and/or common interest agreement in order to receive such information, then the Company shall share whatever information can be shared without entry into such agreement and shall, at the same time, in good faith work expeditiously to enable Investor Counsel and its clients to negotiate and enter into the appropriate agreement(s) without undue burden to the clients of Investor Counsel.] [Indemnification Matters . The Company hereby acknowledges that one or more of the directors affiliated with one or more Investors (“Investor Directors”) may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by one or more of the Investors and certain of their Affiliates (collectively, the “Investor Indemnitors”). The Company hereby agrees (a) that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to any such Investor Director are primary and any obligation of the Investor Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such Investor Director are secondary), (b) that it shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by such Investor Director and shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement by or on behalf of any such Investor Director to the extent legally permitted and as required by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company (or any agreement between the Company and such Investor Director), without regard to any rights such Investor Director may have against the Investor Indemnitors, and, (c) that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Investor Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Investor Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Company further agrees that no advancement or payment by the Investor Indemnitors on behalf of any such Investor Director with respect to any claim for which such Investor Director has sought indemnification from the Company shall affect the foregoing and the Investor Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Investor Director against the Company.

Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors, the Company will not provide to any Foreign Person any DPA Triggering Rights. No Investor that is a Foreign Person shall be permitted to obtain any DPA Triggering Rights or a voting equity interest in the Company that exceeds 10% of the Company’s total voting securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Section 4 of this Agreement, or otherwise, including by way of any secondary transaction(s), without the approval of the Board of Directors.

The Company will not knowingly become, will not knowingly permit any of its subsidiaries to become, and will not knowingly invest in any “covered foreign person” as defined in 31 C.F.R. Part 850, as implemented or revised from time to time (the “Outbound Investment Rules”) in each case without notifying, where reasonably feasible, each Major Investor in advance of such change or investment. Each Investor will notify the Company in writing within a reasonable time if it intends to become, or has a reasonable basis to expect it has or will become, a “person of a country of concern” (within the meaning of the Outbound Investment Rules), and, to the extent reasonably practicable, shall provide such notice in advance of such change.] [Subsidiary Governance .  The Company shall not permit any subsidiary of the Company to take any action without the approval of the Board of Directors to the extent approval of the Board of Directors would be required in the event such action was to be taken by the Company itself, including the requisite groups of directors whose approval would be required in the event such action was to be taken by the Company itself.] Termination of Covenants .

If the consideration proposed to be paid for the Transfer Stock is in property, services or other non-cash consideration, the fair market value of the consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and as set forth in the Company Notice. If the Company or any Investor for any reason cannot or does not wish to pay for the Transfer Stock in the same form of non-cash consideration, the Company or such Investor may pay the cash value equivalent thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors and as set forth in the Company Notice. The closing of the purchase of Transfer Stock by the Company and the Investors shall take place, and all payments from the Company and the Investors shall have been delivered to the selling Key Holder, by the later of (i) the date specified in the Proposed Transfer Notice as the intended date of the Proposed Key Holder Transfer; and (ii) [45] days after delivery of the Proposed Transfer Notice. Right of Co-Sale. Exercise of Right. If any Transfer Stock subject to a Proposed Key Holder Transfer is not purchased pursuant to Section 2.1 above and thereafter is to be sold to a Prospective Transferee, each respective Investor may elect to exercise its Right of Co-Sale and participate on a pro rata basis in the Proposed Key Holder Transfer as set forth in Section 2.2(b) below and, subject to Section 2.2(d), otherwise on the same terms and conditions specified in the Proposed Transfer Notice. Each Investor who desires to exercise its Right of Co-Sale (each, a “Participating Investor”) must give the selling Key Holder written notice to that effect within 15 days after the deadline for delivery of the Secondary Notice described above, and upon giving such notice such Participating Investor shall be deemed to have effectively exercised the Right of Co-Sale. Shares Includable. Each Participating Investor may include in the Proposed Key Holder Transfer all or any part of such Participating Investor’s Capital Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Transfer Stock subject to the Proposed Key Holder Transfer (excluding shares purchased by the Company or the Participating Investors pursuant to the Right of First Refusal or the Secondary Refusal Right) by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Capital Stock owned by such Participating Investor immediately before consummation of the Proposed Key Holder Transfer [(including any shares that such Participating Investor has agreed to purchase pursuant to the Secondary Refusal Right)] and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Capital Stock owned, in the aggregate, by all Participating Investors immediately prior to the consummation of the Proposed Key Holder Transfer [(including any shares that all Participating Investors have collectively agreed to purchase pursuant to the Secondary Refusal Right)], plus the number of shares of Transfer Stock held by the [selling Key Holder][Key Holders]. [To the extent one or more of the Participating Investors exercise such right of participation in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, the number of shares of Transfer Stock that the selling Key Holder may sell in the Proposed Key Holder Transfer shall be correspondingly reduced.] Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Participating Investors and the selling Key Holder agree that the terms and conditions of any Proposed Key Holder Transfer in accordance with this Section 2.2 will be memorialized in, and governed by, a written purchase and sale agreement with the Prospective Transferee (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”) with customary terms and provisions for such a transaction, and the Participating Investors and the selling Key Holder further covenant and agree to enter into such Purchase and Sale Agreement as a condition precedent to any sale or other transfer in accordance with this Section 2.2. Allocation of Consideration. Subject to Section 2.2(d)(ii), the aggregate consideration payable to the Participating Investors and the selling Key Holder shall be allocated based on the number of shares of Capital Stock sold to the Prospective Transferee by each Participating Investor and the selling Key Holder as provided in Section 2.2(b), provided that if a Participating Investor wishes to sell Preferred Stock, the price set forth in the Proposed Transfer Notice shall be appropriately adjusted based on the conversion ratio of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock. In the event that the Proposed Key Holder Transfer constitutes a Change of Control, the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement shall provide that the aggregate consideration from such transfer shall be allocated to the Participating Investors and the selling Key Holder in accordance with Section 2 of Article Fourth, Part B of the Restated Certificate as if (A) such transfer were a Deemed Liquidation Event, and (B) the capital stock sold in accordance with the Purchase and Sale Agreement were the only capital stock outstanding.  Purchase by Selling Key Holder; Deliveries. Notwithstanding Section 2.2(c) above, if any Prospective Transferee(s) refuse(s) to purchase securities subject to the Right of Co-Sale from any Participating Investor or Investors or upon the failure to negotiate in good faith a Purchase and Sale Agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Participating Investors, no Key Holder may sell any Transfer Stock to such Prospective Transferee(s) unless and until, simultaneously with such sale, such Key Holder purchases all securities subject to the Right of Co-Sale from such Participating Investor or Investors on the same terms and conditions (including the proposed purchase price) as set forth in the Proposed Transfer Notice and as provided in Section 2.2(d)(i); provided, however, if such sale constitutes a Change of Control, the portion of the aggregate consideration paid by the selling Key Holder to such Participating Investor or Investors shall be made in accordance with Section 2.2(d)(ii). In connection with such purchase by the selling Key Holder, such Participating Investor or Investors shall deliver to the selling Key Holder any stock certificate or certificates, properly endorsed for transfer, representing the capital stock being purchased by the selling Key Holder (or request that the Company effect such transfer in the name of the selling Key Holder). Any such shares transferred to the selling Key Holder will be transferred to the Prospective Transferee against payment therefor in consummation of the sale of the Transfer Stock pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the Proposed Transfer Notice, and the selling Key Holder shall concurrently therewith remit or direct payment to each such Participating Investor the portion of the aggregate consideration to which each such Participating Investor is entitled by reason of its participation in such sale as provided in this Section 2.2(e).  Additional Compliance. If any Proposed Key Holder Transfer is not consummated within 60 days after receipt of the Proposed Transfer Notice by the Company, the Key Holders proposing the Proposed Key Holder Transfer may not sell any Transfer Stock unless they first comply in full with each provision of this Section 2. The exercise or election not to exercise any right by any Investor hereunder shall not adversely affect its right to participate in any other sales of Transfer Stock subject to this Section 2.2. Effect of Failure to Comply. Transfer Void; Equitable Relief. Any Proposed Key Holder Transfer not made in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement shall be null and void ab initio, shall not be recorded on the books of the Company or its transfer agent and shall not be recognized by the Company. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Agreement would result in substantial harm to the other parties hereto for which monetary damages alone could not adequately compensate. Therefore, the parties hereto unconditionally and irrevocably agree that any non-breaching party hereto shall be entitled to seek protective orders, injunctive relief and other remedies available at law or in equity (including, without limitation, seeking specific performance or the rescission of purchases, sales and other transfers of Transfer Stock not made in strict compliance with this Agreement). Violation of First Refusal Right. If any Key Holder becomes obligated to sell any Transfer Stock to the Company or any Investor under this Agreement and fails to deliver such Transfer Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Company and/or such Investor may, at its option, in addition to all other remedies it may have, send to such Key Holder the purchase price for such Transfer Stock as is herein specified and transfer to the name of the Company or such Investor (or request that the Company effect such transfer in the name of an Investor) on the Company’s books any certificates, instruments, or book entry representing the Transfer Stock to be sold. Violation of Co-Sale Right. If any Key Holder purports to sell any Transfer Stock in contravention of the Right of Co-Sale (a “Prohibited Transfer”), each Participating Investor who desires to exercise its Right of Co-Sale under Section 2.2 may, in addition to such remedies as may be available by law, in equity or hereunder, require such Key Holder to purchase from such Participating Investor the type and number of shares of capital stock that such Participating Investor would have been entitled to sell to the Prospective Transferee had the Prohibited Transfer been effected in compliance with the terms of Section 2.2. The sale will be made on the same terms, including, without limitation, as provided in Section 2.2(d)(i) and the first sentence of Section 2.2(d)(ii), as applicable, and subject to the same conditions as would have applied had the Key Holder not made the Prohibited Transfer, except that the sale (including, without limitation, the delivery of the purchase price) must be made within 90 days after the Participating Investor learns of the Prohibited Transfer, as opposed to the timeframe proscribed in Section 2.2. Such Key Holder shall also reimburse each Participating Investor for any and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred pursuant to the exercise or the attempted exercise of the Participating Investor’s rights under Section 2.2. [Limitation on Foreign Person Investors . Notwithstanding the covenants set forth in this Section 2, no Investor that is a Foreign Person shall be permitted to obtain greater than 9.9% of the outstanding voting shares of the Company.]  [Entity Transfers. No Key Holder that is a trust, corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity shall engage or permit any Entity Transfer without complying with this Agreement mutatis mutandis as if such Entity Transfer were a direct Transfer of Transfer Stock by the Key Holder.] Exempt Transfers. Exempt Transfers . Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of Sections 2.1 and 2.2 shall not apply (a) in the case of a Key Holder that is an entity, upon a Transfer by such Key Holder to its stockholders, members, partners or other equity holders; (b) to a repurchase of Transfer Stock from a Key Holder by the Company at a price no greater than that originally paid by such Key Holder for such Transfer Stock and pursuant to an agreement containing vesting and/or repurchase provisions approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors; [or]  (c) in the case of a Key Holder that is a natural person, upon a Transfer of Transfer Stock by such Key Holder made for bona fide estate planning purposes, either during such person’s lifetime or on death by will or intestacy to such person’s spouse, including any life partner or similar statutorily-recognized domestic partner, child (natural or adopted), or any other direct lineal descendant of such Key Holder (or such person’s spouse, including any life partner or similar statutorily-recognized domestic partner) (all of the foregoing collectively referred to as “family members”), or any other Person approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors, or any custodian or trustee of any trust, partnership, limited liability company or other corporate entity for the benefit of, or the ownership interests of which are owned wholly by such Key Holder or any such family members[; (d) to a pledge of Transfer Stock that creates a mere security interest in the pledged Transfer Stock, provided that the pledgee thereof agrees in writing in advance to be bound by and comply with all applicable provisions of this Agreement to the same extent as if it were the Key Holder making such pledge;] [or (e) to the sale by the Key Holder of up to [__]% of the Transfer Stock held by such Key Holder as of the date that such Key Holder first became party to this Agreement (including any agreement of which this Agreement is a direct or indirect amendment or restatement)]; provided that in the case of clause[(s)] (a)[, (c), (d) or (e)], the Key Holder shall deliver prior written notice to the Investors of such pledge, gift or transfer and such shares of Transfer Stock shall at all times remain subject to the terms and restrictions set forth in this Agreement and such transferee shall, as a condition to such Transfer, deliver a counterpart signature page to this Agreement as confirmation that such transferee shall be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a Key Holder (but only with respect to the securities so transferred to the transferee), including the obligations of a Key Holder with respect to Proposed Key Holder Transfers of such Transfer Stock pursuant to Section 2; and provided further in the case of any transfer pursuant to clause (a) or (c) above, that such transfer is made pursuant to a transaction in which there is no consideration actually paid for such transfer. Exempted Offerings . Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of Section 2 shall not apply to the sale of any Transfer Stock (a) to the public in an offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (a “Public Offering”); or (b) pursuant to a Deemed Liquidation Event. Prohibited Transferees . Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Key Holder shall transfer any Transfer Stock to any (a) Competitor; (b) customer, distributor or supplier of the Company, if the majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors should determine that such transfer would result in such customer, distributor or supplier receiving information that would place the Company at a competitive disadvantage with respect to such customer, distributor or supplier; (c) Sanctioned Party. [(d) Foreign Person that pursuant to any such transfer would acquire any DPA Triggering Rights, unless otherwise approved by the majority of the disinterested members of the] Board of Directors]. Legend . Each certificate, instrument, or book entry representing shares of Transfer Stock held by the Key Holders or issued to any permitted transferee in connection with a transfer permitted by Section 3.1 hereof shall be notated with the following legend: THE SALE, PLEDGE, HYPOTHECATION, OR TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY IS SUBJECT TO, AND IN CERTAIN CASES PROHIBITED BY, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A CERTAIN RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL AND CO-SALE AGREEMENT BY AND AMONG THE STOCKHOLDER, THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OTHER HOLDERS OF STOCK OF THE CORPORATION. COPIES OF SUCH AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF THE CORPORATION. Each Key Holder agrees that the Company may instruct its transfer agent to impose transfer restrictions on the shares notated with the legend referred to in this Section 4 to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, and the Company agrees to promptly do so. The legend shall be removed upon termination of this Agreement at the request of the holder. Lock-Up. Agreement to Lock-Up . Each Key Holder hereby agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the managing underwriter, during the period commencing on the date of the final prospectus relating to a Public Offering, the registration by the Company of shares of its Common Stock or any other equity securities on a registration statement (other than a Form S-8), and ending on the date specified by the managing underwriter or the Company, as applicable (such period not to exceed 180 days, or such other period as may be requested by the Company or an underwriter to accommodate regulatory restrictions on (1) the publication or other distribution of research reports and (2) analyst recommendations and opinions, including, but not limited to, the restrictions contained in applicable FINRA rules, or any successor provisions or amendments thereto), (a) lend; offer; pledge; sell; contract to sell; sell any option or contract to purchase; purchase any option or contract to sell; grant any option, right, or warrant to purchase; or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock (or other equity securities of the Company) or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable (directly or indirectly) for such Common Stock (or other equity securities) held or (b) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the capital stock, whether any such transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) above is to be settled by delivery of capital stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing provisions of this Section 5 shall not apply to the sale of any shares to an underwriter pursuant to an underwriting agreement or to the establishment of a trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1, provided that such plan does not permit transfers during the restricted period. The Company’s underwriters are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5 and shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto. Each Key Holder further agrees to execute such agreements as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters that are consistent with this Section 5 or that are necessary to give further effect thereto. In the event a Key Holder is or becomes party to a lock-up or market standoff agreement with the Company or any third party beneficiary of this Section 5.1 that contains terms that are more restrictive to the Key Holder, the Key Holder agrees that the Key Holder shall be subject to the more restrictive terms and compliance therewith shall be deemed compliance herewith. Stop Transfer Instructions . In order to enforce the foregoing covenant, the Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the shares of capital stock of each Key Holder (and transferees and assignees thereof) until the end of such restricted period. Survival . Unless and only to the extent otherwise superseded by an underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten Public Offering, the obligations of the Key Holders under this Section 5 shall survive the termination of this Agreement or any provision(s) of this Agreement.  Miscellaneous. Term . This Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of (a) immediately prior to the consummation of the Company’s initial Public Offering (“IPO”) [or Qualified Direct Listing, as applicable], and (b) the consummation of a Deemed Liquidation Event [in which the consideration received by the Investors in such Deemed Liquidation Event is in the form of cash and/or publicly traded securities, or if the Investors receive substantially similar rights]. Stock Split . All references to numbers of shares in this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock dividend, split, combination or other recapitalization affecting the capital stock occurring after the date of this Agreement. Ownership . Each Key Holder represents and warrants that such Key Holder is the sole legal and beneficial owner of the shares of Transfer Stock subject to this Agreement and that no other person or entity has any interest in such shares (other than a community property interest as to which the holder thereof has acknowledged and agreed in writing to the restrictions and obligations hereunder).

Such arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if no agreement can be reached within 30 days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.

Delays or Omissions . No delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing to any party under this Agreement, upon any breach or default of any other party under this Agreement, shall impair any such right, power or remedy of such non-breaching or non-defaulting party nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any party of any breach or default under this Agreement, or any waiver on the part of any party of any provisions or conditions of this Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.

This Agreement may be amended, modified or terminated (other than pursuant to Section 6.1 above) and the observance of any term hereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a written instrument executed by (i) the Company, (ii) the [Qualified] Key Holders holding [specify percentage] of the shares of Transfer Stock then held by all of the [Qualified] Key Holders [provided that such consent shall not be required if the Key Holders do not then own shares of Capital Stock representing at least [__]% of the outstanding Capital Stock of the Company], and (iii) the holders of at least [specify percentage]% of the shares of Preferred Stock then held by the Investors (voting as a single separate class and on an as-converted basis); provided that the Company may in its sole discretion waive compliance with any provision of this Agreement if observance of the terms would cause the Company or any Investor to be in violation of applicable Sanctions.  Any amendment, modification, termination or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 6.8 shall be binding upon the Company, the Investors, the Key Holders and all of their respective successors and permitted assigns whether or not such party, assignee or other shareholder entered into or approved such amendment, modification, termination or waiver.  [Notwithstanding Section 6.8(a) above, (i) this Agreement may not be amended, modified or terminated and the observance of any term hereunder may not be waived with respect to any Investor or Key Holder without the written consent of such Investor or Key Holder unless such amendment, modification, termination or waiver applies to all Investors and Key Holders, respectively, in the same fashion [(it being agreed that a waiver of the provisions of Section 2 with respect to a particular transaction shall be deemed to apply to all Investors in the same fashion if such waiver does so by its terms, notwithstanding the fact that certain Investors may nonetheless, by agreement with the Company, purchase or sell securities in such transaction; [provided, however, if, after giving effect to any waiver of Section 2 with respect to a particular transaction, a waiving Investor in fact purchases or sells securities in such transaction (a “Participating Investor”), the aforementioned waiver shall be deemed to apply to any Investor only if that Investor has been provided the opportunity to purchase or sell a proportional number of the securities in such transaction based on relative participation of all Participating Investors)]], (ii) no consent of any Key Holder shall be required for a waiver of the applicability of the rights provided in Section 2 of this Agreement as to any specific Proposed Key Holder Transfer, (iii) the consent of the Key Holders shall not be required for any amendment, modification, termination or waiver if such amendment, modification, termination or waiver does not apply to the Key Holders, and (iv) Schedule A hereto may be amended by the Company from time to time in accordance with the Purchase Agreement to add information regarding Additional Purchasers (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) without the consent of the other parties hereto.]  The Company shall give prompt written notice of any amendment, modification or termination hereof or waiver hereunder to any party hereto whose rights and/or obligations were affected by such amendment, modification, termination, or waiver and that did not consent in writing to such amendment, modification, termination or waiver; provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not invalidate any amendment, modification, termination or waiver hereunder; and provided further, for clarity, that no such notice shall be required to be given to any Key Holder for a waiver of the applicability of the rights provided in Section 2 of this Agreement as to any specific Proposed Key Holder Transfer that does not involve any Transfer Stock held by such Key Holder.  No waivers of or exceptions to any term, condition or provision of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be, or construed as, a further or continuing waiver of any such term, condition or provision. Any amendment, modification, termination, or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 6.8 shall be binding on all parties hereto, regardless of whether any such party has consented thereto or received notice thereof.

Any successor or permitted assignee of any Key Holder, including any Prospective Transferee who purchases shares of Transfer Stock in accordance with the terms hereof, shall deliver to the Company and the Investors, as a condition to any transfer or assignment, a counterpart signature page hereto pursuant to which such successor or permitted assignee shall confirm their agreement to be subject to and bound by all of the provisions set forth in this Agreement that were applicable to the predecessor or assignor of such successor or permitted assignee.

Except in connection with an assignment by the Company by operation of law to the acquirer of the Company, the rights and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned under any circumstances.

Additional Key Holders . In the event that after the date of this Agreement, the Company issues shares of Common Stock, or options to purchase Common Stock, to any employee or consultant, which shares or options would collectively constitute with respect to such employee or consultant (taking into account all shares of Common Stock, options and other purchase rights held by such employee or consultant) 1% or more of the Company’s then outstanding Common Stock (treating for this purpose all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of or conversion of outstanding options, warrants or convertible securities, as if exercised or converted), the Company shall, as a condition to such issuance, cause such employee or consultant to execute a counterpart signature page hereto as a Key Holder, and such person shall thereby be bound by, and subject to, all the terms and provisions of this Agreement applicable to a Key Holder.

NVCA-Model-SPA-10-28-2025_1,NVCA-Model-SPA-10-28-2025,"Preliminary Note The Stock Purchase Agreement sets forth the basic terms of the purchase and sale of the preferred stock to the investors (such as the purchase price, closing date, conditions to closing) and identifies the other financing documents. Generally this agreement does not set forth either (1) the characteristics of the stock being sold (which are defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) or (2) the relationship among the parties after the closing, such as registration rights, rights of first refusal and co-sale and voting arrangements (these matters often implicate persons other than just the Company and the investors in this round of financing and are usually embodied in separate agreements to which those others persons are parties, or in some cases in the Certificate of Incorporation). The main items of negotiation in the Stock Purchase Agreement are the representations and warranties that the Company must make to the investors and the closing conditions for the transaction. SERIES [___] PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT THIS SERIES [___] PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), is made as of [________], 20[__], by and among [____________], a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and the investors listed on Exhibit A attached to this Agreement (each a “Purchaser” and together the “Purchasers”). The parties hereby agree as follows: Purchase and Sale of Preferred Stock. Sale and Issuance of Preferred Stock. The Company shall have adopted and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on or before the Initial Closing (as defined below) the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the form of Exhibit B attached to this Agreement (the “Restated Certificate”). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Purchaser agrees to purchase, and the Company agrees to sell and issue to each Purchaser, at the [applicable] Closing (as defined below) that number of shares of Series [___] Preferred Stock, $[__] par value per share (the “Series [___] Preferred Stock”), set forth opposite each Purchaser’s name on Exhibit A [with respect to such Closing], at a purchase price of $[__] per share [or, as applicable, a purchase price of $[___] per share with respect to the shares of Series [____] Preferred Stock being issued [in the Initial Closing] pursuant to any cancellation or conversion of Convertible Securities (as defined below) as set forth in Section 1.3 below], subject to adjustment of such per share amounts for stock splits, stock combinations, stock dividends, and the like that occur between the date of this Agreement and the applicable Closing (as defined below). The shares of Series [___] Preferred Stock issued to the Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement shall be referred to in this Agreement as the “Shares.” In the event there is more than one closing, the term “Closing” shall apply to each such closing unless otherwise specified. Closing[s]; Delivery. [Initial Closing.] The [initial] purchase and sale of the Shares shall take place remotely via the exchange of documents and signatures, on the date of this Agreement at such time as is mutually agreed upon, orally or in writing, by the Company and the Purchasers (the consummation of such purchase and sale being designated as the “[Initial] Closing”). , [Each Purchaser at the Initial Closing shall be obligated to purchase that number of Tranche Closing Shares (as defined below) as is set forth opposite such Purchaser’s name on Exhibit A under the heading “Tranche Closing Shares” (as to any Purchaser, its “Tranche Closing Shares”), as provided in Section [1.2(c)] below.] [Additional Closings. After the Initial Closing and on or before [date], the Company may sell, on the same terms and conditions as those contained in this Agreement, any unsold shares [up to [_________] additional shares (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or similar recapitalization affecting such shares)] of Series [___] Preferred Stock (the “Additional Shares”), to one or more purchasers (the “Additional Purchasers”) [reasonably acceptable to Purchasers holding a [specify percentage] of the then outstanding Shares] in any number of Closings (each an “Additional Closing”), provided that [(i)]  each Additional Purchaser becomes a party to the Investors’ Rights Agreement, the Voting Agreement, and the Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale Agreement, each as defined below, by executing and delivering a counterpart signature page to each of such Transaction Agreements [and (ii) each Additional Purchaser in an Additional Closing occurring prior to the Tranche Closing shall be obligated to purchase such Purchaser’s Tranche Closing Shares, as provided in Section [1.2(c)] below]. Exhibit A to this Agreement shall be updated to reflect [(i)] the number of Additional Shares purchased at each such Closing and the parties purchasing such Additional Shares [and (ii) the number of Tranche Closing Shares, if applicable, required to be purchased by each Additional Purchaser.]  [Tranche Closing.  Tranche Closing. If, on or before [date] (the “Outside Date”), the Tranche Closing Condition (as defined below) is satisfied, then (A) the Company shall promptly deliver a written notice to the Purchasers (the “Tranche Closing Notice”) confirming the satisfaction of the Tranche Closing Condition and specifying the Tranche Closing Date (as defined below) and (B) each Purchaser that has purchased Shares prior to the Tranche Closing Date shall be obligated to purchase (together with its Affiliates but without duplication) its Tranche Closing Shares (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.2(c)(ii)) in an additional closing on the Tranche Closing Date (the “Tranche Closing”). At the Tranche Closing, the Company shall sell to each Purchaser, and each Purchaser shall purchase from the Company, such Purchaser’s Tranche Closing Shares. Exhibit A to this Agreement shall be updated to reflect the number of any Tranche Closing Shares purchased by such Purchaser at the Tranche Closing, if consummated. [Elective Closings. Each Purchaser may elect to purchase from the Company up to the full number of its Tranche Closing Shares at any time prior to the Tranche Closing, in one or more closings to occur pursuant to this Section 1.2(c) (each, an “Elective Closing”), subject, in each case, to such Purchaser providing the Company with at least [3] business days’ prior written notice (an “Elective Notice”) of the date on which such Purchaser shall purchase such Tranche Closing Shares. Promptly following receipt of any Elective Notice the Company shall provide a copy of such Elective Notice to each other Purchaser that did not submit a substantially concurrent Elective Notice.  Any purchase of such Tranche Closing Shares by such Purchaser at an Elective Closing shall proportionately reduce such Purchaser’s obligation to purchase its Tranche Closing Shares at the Tranche Closing. Exhibit A to this Agreement shall be updated to reflect the number of any Tranche Closing Shares purchased by such Purchaser at any Elective Closing.] Shortfall Closing. If any Tranche Shares remain unpurchased immediately following the Tranche Closing (the “Shortfall Shares”), the Company shall, within five business days following the Tranche Closing Date, provide written notice to each Purchaser that is not a Defaulting Purchaser (each, a “Complying Purchaser,” and such notice, the “Shortfall Notice”), setting forth the total number of Shortfall Shares and the date for the Shortfall Closing (as defined below). Each Complying Purchaser will have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the Shortfall Shares on a pro rata basis based on the number of Shares then held by such Complying Purchaser compared to the total number of Shares then held by all Complying Purchasers electing to purchase Shortfall Shares at a Closing (a “Shortfall Closing”), exercisable by delivering written notice to the Company within [5] business days after the Company’s delivery of the Shortfall Notice, which notice shall also specify the maximum number of Shortfall Shares, if any, such Complying Purchaser wishes to purchase in excess of such Complying Purchaser’s pro rata percentage (the “Excess Amount”) (each Complying Purchaser electing to purchase being referred to herein as a “Participating Purchaser”). Any Shortfall Shares not elected to be purchased by a Complying Purchaser shall automatically be deemed elected to be purchased by the Participating Purchasers who specified an Excess Amount in their respective notices delivered to the Company, and allocated among such Participating Purchasers in proportion to their respective pro rata percentages; provided, that in no event shall an amount greater than a Participating Purchaser’s Excess Amount be allocated to such Participating Purchaser. The procedure set forth in the preceding sentence shall be applied on an iterative basis until the entire Excess Amount of each Participating Purchaser has been satisfied or until all Shortfall Shares shall have been allocated. In no event shall a Complying Purchaser be deemed to be a Defaulting Purchaser as a result of such Complying Purchaser’s failure to purchase shares at a Shortfall Closing. Any Shortfall Closing shall occur on the date specified in the Shortfall Notice, which date shall be not less than [15] business days after and not more [20] business days after the date on which the Shortfall Notice is delivered to the Complying Purchasers. Exhibit A to this Agreement shall be updated to reflect the number of any Shortfall Shares (if any) purchased by each Purchaser at the Shortfall Closing. [Special Mandatory Conversion.   Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement or the Restated Certificate, and unless this Section 1.2(c)(iv) is waived in writing by the Requisite Purchasers with respect to all Purchasers, if any Purchaser, together with such Purchaser’s Affiliates, fails to purchase its required number of Tranche Closing Shares at the Tranche Closing (including for calculation purposes all Tranche Closing Shares purchased at any Elective Closing)  (any such Purchaser, a “Defaulting Purchaser”), then each Share held by such Defaulting Purchaser as of immediately prior to the Tranche Closing (the “Subject Preferred Stock”) shall automatically, and without any further action on the part of such Defaulting Purchaser, the Company or any other Person, be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”) at the rate of [one-tenth] of a share of Common Stock for each one share of the Subject Preferred Stock, all pursuant to, and as further provided in, Article Fourth, Part B, Section [5A.1] of the Restated Certificate (a “Special Mandatory Conversion”).  Upon a Special Mandatory Conversion, all rights with respect to the Series [___] Preferred Stock converted pursuant to such Special Mandatory Conversion, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate  (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates for such shares on or prior to such time), except for the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates therefor, to receive a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion. In addition, any Defaulting Purchaser’s (i) right to designate a member of the Board and/or an observer to meetings of the Board (if such conversion results in such Defaulting Purchaser’s holdings falling below requisite levels), (ii) with respect to the Common Stock issued pursuant to a Special Mandatory Conversion only, registration rights and rights to purchase future issuances of equity of the Company under the Investors’ Rights Agreement, as defined below, and (iii) with respect to the Common Stock issued pursuant to a Special Mandatory Conversion only, rights of first refusal and co-sale under the Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale Agreement, as defined below, in each case pursuant to any agreement with the Company, shall all automatically terminate upon such conversion, effective upon, subject to, and concurrently with, the consummation of the Tranche Closing. Any Defaulting Purchaser hereby agrees to execute and deliver any additional documents and instruments and perform any additional acts that may be necessary or appropriate to confirm any of the foregoing as reasonably requested by the Company. The Company and the Purchasers agree that the Special Mandatory Conversion provisions of this Agreement and Article Fourth, Part B, Section 5.A of the Restated Certificate shall be the sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for the Company or any other Purchaser against any Defaulting Purchaser for the failure to purchase its Tranche Closing Shares at the Tranche Closing. As a condition to any transfer of a Purchaser’s Series [___] Preferred Stock (or Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof pursuant to Article Fourth, Part B, Section 4 of the Restated Certificate), the transferee must agree to receive such Series [__] Preferred Stock subject to the provisions and upon the conditions specified in this Agreement, including this Section 1.2 Termination of Section 1.2(c).  This Section 1.2(c) shall terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the first to occur of (i) the Outside Date, (ii) the consummation of the Company’s first underwritten public offering of its Common Stock, under the Securities Act, or (iii) a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in the Restated Certificate) (each, a “Termination Event”). The Company shall provide each Purchaser with at least 10 business days’ prior written notice of any Termination Event to enable each Purchaser to consummate an Elective Closing prior to such Termination Event.] Closing Deliverables.  At each Closing, the Company shall deliver to each Purchaser a certificate representing the Shares being purchased by such Purchaser at such Closing against payment of the purchase price therefor by check payable to the Company, by wire transfer to a bank account designated by the Company, by cancellation or conversion of indebtedness or other convertible securities of the Company to Purchaser[, including interest], or by any combination of such methods. Conversion and Termination of Convertible Securities. By executing and delivering this Agreement, each Purchaser holding one or more [simple agreements for future equity and/or convertible notes] issued by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (each, regardless of whether held by a Purchaser or not, a “Convertible Security” and, collectively, regardless of whether held by a Purchaser or not, the “Convertible Securities”) hereby irrevocably agrees that: The aggregate face amount of all Convertible Securities held by such Purchaser is set forth on Exhibit A under the column heading “Convertible Securities”; Such Purchaser is the sole owner of all right, title and interest in and to the Convertible Securities corresponding to the amounts shown opposite such Purchaser’s name on Exhibit A; At the Initial Closing, all of such Purchaser’s Convertible Securities will automatically and without any action on the part of such Purchaser convert into the number of shares of Series [___] Preferred Stock set forth opposite such Purchaser’s name under the column heading “Convertible Security Shares” on Exhibit A (as to any Purchaser, such shares being such Purchaser’s “Convertible Security Shares”), regardless of whether any such Convertible Securities or an affidavit of loss therefor is actually delivered in original or other form to the Company, and any original Convertible Securities held by (or delivered (electronically or otherwise) to) the Company may be cancelled (and marked cancelled) by the Company upon or following the Initial Closing; and As to such Purchaser, such Purchaser’s Convertible Security Shares are issued in full and complete discharge and satisfaction of all obligations of the Company (including outstanding principal, interest or any other amounts) under such Purchaser’s Convertible Securities, and such Convertible Securities will be terminated and of no further force or effect automatically immediately upon the Initial Closing. [The Company and its Affiliates and agents shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts deliverable pursuant to Purchaser’s Convertible Securities (including any Convertible Security Shares otherwise issuable with respect thereto) such amounts, if any, as are required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or any other applicable tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and duly paid over to the appropriate tax authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of the Transaction Agreements as having been delivered to the person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. Each person holding Convertible Securities shall, upon request, use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the applicable withholding agent with all necessary tax forms, including a duly executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate version of IRS Form W-8, as applicable. Prior to withholding any amounts pursuant to this Section 1.3(b), the Company (and its Affiliates and agents) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Purchaser, and the Company and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to reduce or eliminate any such withholding.] The Company and each Purchaser holding a Convertible Security hereby agree[, on behalf of themselves and all holders of Convertible Securities,] that [such/all] Convertible Securities hereby are and will be deemed for all purposes to have been amended and modified by virtue hereof to the full extent necessary to permit and facilitate their conversion as provided in this Agreement into Convertible Security Shares, to fix the conversion price (as defined therein) at $[___] per share, and, immediately upon the Initial Closing, all Convertible Securities shall be deemed terminated in full and null, void and of no further force or effect; provided that the foregoing will not impair the right of the holder of a Convertible Security to receive the applicable number of Convertible Security Shares shown opposite such holder’s name on Exhibit A-1.

Purchase Entirely for Own Account . This Agreement is made with the Purchaser in reliance upon the Purchaser’s representation to the Company, which by the Purchaser’s execution of this Agreement, the Purchaser hereby confirms, that the Shares to be acquired by the Purchaser will be acquired for investment for the Purchaser’s own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and that the Purchaser has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same.

The Purchaser understands that the Shares are “restricted securities” under applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and that, pursuant to these laws, the Purchaser must hold the Shares indefinitely unless they are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such registration and qualification requirements is available. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Company has no obligation to register or qualify the Shares, or the Common Stock into which it may be converted, for resale except as set forth in the Investors’ Rights Agreement. The Purchaser further acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or qualification is available, it may be conditioned on various requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for the Shares, and on requirements relating to the Company which are outside of the Purchaser’s control, and which the Company is under no obligation and may not be able to satisfy. [The Purchaser acknowledges that the Company filed a registration statement for a public offering of its Common Stock, which was withdrawn effective [_____ __, 20_].

The Purchaser understands that no public market now exists for the Shares, and that the Company has made no assurances that a public market will ever exist for the Shares. Legends .

NO SUCH TRANSFER MAY BE EFFECTED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED THERETO OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN A FORM SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.” Any legend set forth in, or required by, the other Transaction Agreements. Any legend required by the securities laws of any state to the extent such laws are applicable to the Shares represented by the certificate, instrument, or book entry so legended.

The Company shall amend Schedule A to include such purchaser as an Investor and Stockholder, but failure to update Schedule A shall not negate such Investor’s rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that after the date of this Agreement, the Company enters into an agreement with any Person to issue shares of capital stock [or options or warrants to purchase shares of capital stock] to such Person (other than to a purchaser of Preferred Stock described in Section 7.1(a) above), [following which such Person shall hold Shares constituting 1% or more of the then outstanding capital stock of the Company (treating for this purpose all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of outstanding options, warrants or convertible securities, as if exercised and/or converted or exchanged)], then such Person, as a condition precedent to entering into such agreement or acquiring such shares[, options, or warrants] shall become a party to this Agreement by executing and delivering a counterpart signature page to this Agreement agreeing to be bound by and subject to the terms of this Agreement as a Stockholder and, if applicable, a Key Holder. Each such Person shall thereafter be deemed a Stockholder and, if applicable, a Key Holder for all purposes under this Agreement. If such Person is not a Key Holder, then the Company shall amend Schedule C to include such purchaser as Stockholder.  Alternatively, if such Person is a Key Holder, the Company shall amend Schedule B to include such Person as a Key Holder.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure to update Schedule B or Schedule C, as applicable, shall not negate such Stockholder’s (and, if applicable, Key Holder’s) rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement. A Person who becomes party to this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall solely be a “Stockholder”, unless such Person being designated a “Key Holder” is approved by [the Company in its sole discretion]. Transfers. Each transferee or assignee of any Shares subject to this Agreement shall continue to be subject to the terms hereof, and, as a condition precedent to the Company’s recognition of such transfer, each transferee or assignee shall agree in writing to be subject to each of the terms of this Agreement by executing and delivering a counterpart signature page in this Agreement, agreeing to be bound by and subject to the terms of this Agreement in the same capacity as the transferor. Upon the execution and delivery of a counterpart signature page to this Agreement by any transferee, such transferee shall be deemed to be a party hereto as if such transferee were the transferor and such transferee’s signature appeared on the signature pages of this Agreement and shall be deemed to be an Investor and Stockholder, or Key Holder and Stockholder, as applicable. The Company shall not permit the transfer of the Shares subject to this Agreement on its books or issue a new certificate representing any such Shares unless and until such transferee shall have complied with the terms of this Section 7.2. Each certificate instrument, or book entry representing the Shares subject to this Agreement if issued on or after the date of this Agreement shall be notated by the Company with the legend set forth in Section 7.12. The Company shall amend the applicable Schedules to include such transferee as an Investor, Key Holder, and/or Stockholder, as applicable, but the Company’s failure to update the Schedules to this Agreement shall not negate such Stockholder’s rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Successors and Assigns. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the respective successors and assigns of the parties; provided, however, that the rights to designate members of the Board in Section[s] [1.2(a)-(b)] are nontransferable (and shall not be binding upon or inure to the benefit of successors and assigns) other than pursuant to an amendment effected in accordance with Section 7.8 below. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal law of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in the application of any law other than the law of the State of Delaware.

To the extent that any notice given by means of electronic mail is returned or undeliverable for any reason, the foregoing consent shall be deemed to have been revoked until a new or corrected electronic mail address has been provided, and such attempted electronic notice shall be ineffective and deemed to not have been given. Each Stockholder agrees to promptly notify the Company of any change in its electronic mail address, and that failure to do so shall not affect the foregoing. Consent Required to Amend, Modify, Terminate or Waive.

The Company shall give prompt written notice of any amendment, modification, termination, or waiver hereunder to any party whose rights and/or obligations were affected by such amendment, modification, termination, or waiver and that did not consent in writing to such amendment, modification, termination, or waiver; provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not invalidate any amendment, modification, termination, or waiver in accordance with this Section 7.8.  Any amendment, modification, termination, or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 7.8 shall be binding on each party and all of such party’s successors and permitted assigns, whether or not any such party, successor or assignee entered into or approved such amendment, modification, termination or waiver or received notice thereof.  For purposes of this Section 7.8, the requirement of a written instrument may be satisfied in the form of an action by written consent of the Stockholders circulated by the Company and executed by the Stockholder parties specified, whether or not such action by written consent makes explicit reference to the terms of this Agreement.  Delays or Omissions. No delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing to any party under this Agreement, upon any breach or default of any other party under this Agreement, shall impair any such right, power or remedy of such non-breaching or non-defaulting party nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default previously or thereafter occurring. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any party of any breach or default under this Agreement, or any waiver on the part of any party of any provisions or conditions of this Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by law or otherwise afforded to any party, shall be cumulative and not alternative.  Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. Entire Agreement. [Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, the Prior Agreement shall be deemed amended and restated and superseded and replaced in its entirety by this Agreement, and shall be of no further force or effect.] This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) together with the Restated Certificate and other Transaction Agreements (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) and any Side Letters constitute the full and entire understanding and agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and any other written or oral agreement relating to the subject matter hereof existing between or among any of the parties are expressly canceled.

Events  	(a)	Equity Financing. If there is an Equity Financing before the termination of this Safe, on the initial closing of such Equity Financing, this Safe will automatically convert into the number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Discount Price. 	In connection with the automatic conversion of this Safe into shares of Safe Preferred Stock, the Investor will execute and deliver to the Company all of the transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; provided, that such documents (i) are the same documents to be entered into with the purchasers of Standard Preferred Stock, with appropriate variations for the Safe Preferred Stock if applicable, and (ii) have customary exceptions to any drag-along applicable to the Investor, including (without limitation) limited representations, warranties, liability and indemnification obligations for the Investor. 	(b)	Liquidity Event. If there is a Liquidity Event before the termination of this Safe, the Investor will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of such Liquidity Event, equal to the greater of (i) the Purchase Amount (the “Cash-Out Amount”) or (ii) the amount payable on the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price (the “Conversion Amount”).  If any of the Company’s securityholders are given a choice as to the form and amount of Proceeds to be received in a Liquidity Event, the Investor will be given the same choice, provided that the Investor may not choose to receive a form of consideration that the Investor would be ineligible to receive as a result of the Investor’s failure to satisfy any requirement or limitation generally applicable to the Company’s securityholders, or under any applicable laws. 	Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with a Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, the Company may reduce the cash portion of Proceeds payable to the Investor by the amount determined by its board of directors in good faith for such Change of Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that such reduction (A) does not reduce the total Proceeds payable to such Investor and (B) is applied in the same manner and on a pro rata basis to all securityholders who have equal priority to the Investor under Section 1(d). 	(c)	Dissolution Event. If there is a Dissolution Event before the termination of this Safe, the Investor will automatically be entitled (subject to the liquidation priority set forth in Section 1(d) below) to receive a portion of Proceeds equal to the Cash-Out Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event. (d) Liquidation Priority.  In a Liquidity Event or Dissolution Event, this Safe is intended to operate like standard non-participating Preferred Stock.  The Investor’s right to receive its Cash-Out Amount is: (i)	Junior to payment of outstanding indebtedness and creditor claims, including contractual claims for payment and convertible promissory notes (to the extent such convertible promissory notes are not actually or notionally converted into Capital Stock);  (ii)	On par with payments for other Safes and/or Preferred Stock, and if the applicable Proceeds are insufficient to permit full payments to the Investor and such other Safes and/or Preferred Stock, the applicable Proceeds will be distributed pro rata to the Investor and such other Safes and/or Preferred Stock in proportion to the full payments that would otherwise be due; and  		(iii)	Senior to payments for Common Stock. 	The Investor’s right to receive its Conversion Amount is (A) on par with payments for Common Stock and other Safes and/or Preferred Stock who are also receiving Conversion Amounts or Proceeds on a similar as-converted to Common Stock basis, and (B) junior to payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) above (in the latter case, to the extent such payments are Cash-Out Amounts or similar liquidation preferences). 	(e)	Termination.  This Safe will automatically terminate (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with this Safe) immediately following the earliest to occur of: (i) the issuance of Capital Stock to the Investor pursuant to the automatic conversion of this Safe under Section 1(a); or (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Investor pursuant to Section 1(b) or Section 1(c).",Representations & Warranties,High
